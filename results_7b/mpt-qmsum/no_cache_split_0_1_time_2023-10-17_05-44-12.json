Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training.\n\nKirsty Williams AM: I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65% of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now \u00a320,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise.

In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups.

I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age group we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children.

They are worried that a lack of online support is preventing their children from engaging effectively with their studies and that some of them are struggling to catch up with their peers. They are also concerned about the lack of support for children with additional needs, particularly those with special educational needs or disabilities. Could the Minister assure me that she is taking this issue seriously and that the Welsh Government is doing everything it can to support schools and parents during this difficult time?\n\nVaughan Gething AM: I understand the concerns that have been raised about the level of disruption and the impact of the pandemic on education. The Welsh Government has provided additional funding to support schools and pupils during this difficult time. We have also provided guidance and resources to help schools to continue to support pupils with their learning, including those with special educational needs or disabilities. However, I recognise that there are challenges that we are still facing, and I am working with education stakeholders to address these challenges and ensure that all pupils have the support they need to continue their education. I will continue to work with schools, parents, and stakeholders to ensure that we provide the best possible support to our children during this difficult time.\n\nSian Gwenllian AM: Thank you, Minister.

And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins. And I 'll give you the digit strings first, so can see how that goes. Um.\nOn the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can. If you're not exactly sure about the region, we're not exactly sure either. So, don 't worry too much about it.\nThe idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting, and record it, and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on, on the meeting. So that my particular interest, is a portable device to do information retrieval on meetings. Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings. Um.\nThank you. So, uh, just also a note on wearing the microphones. All of you look like you're doing it reasonably correctly, but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth, and then, at the corner.

They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential."], "response": "The meeting transcript indicates that the participants are discussing the design of a new television remote control. They agree that it should be original, trendy, modern, and friendly, with the right buttons in the right place. They decide that there will be three stages in the design process: functional, conceptual, and detailed design. Each stage will involve meeting, discussing, and then moving on to the next phase. The participants also note that they have two Smartboards available and that they can use them just like a computer, with the ability to save and open files. The meeting ends with a plan to meet again in thirty minutes.<|im_end|>"}

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce."], "response": "Kirsty Williams AM: \"I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months.

The industrial designer mentioned that they will use a normal battery, as it is the cheapest option, but they may use a kinetic battery or an advanced chip depending on the features and LCD display.
