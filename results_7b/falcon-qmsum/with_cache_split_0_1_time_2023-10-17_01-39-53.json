This trust may be absent when the doctor has a negative emotional reaction to a woman's pain or mental anguish, and it is not uncommon for a doctor to criticize a woman's complaint of pain or sadness as \"garbage\" or \"complaint-itis.\" Such negative views of the physical and emotional suffering experienced by these women may also lead to unnecessary clinical involvement.\n\nAdditionally, some doctors may feel uncomfortable with the concept of \"empathy\" in the medical world because they are taught that \"resistance\" is an integral component of the doctor-patient relationship. To many, \"empathy\" is seen as unnecessary because it hinders the development of a rational medical approach to pregnancy-related issues. As a result, the doctor's lack of acceptance of the mother's pain and anxiety can lead to a deterioration in their relationship, which can subsequently lead to a decline in their capacity to work effectively as a doctor in the following weeks.\n\nAs a result, some doctors may feel uncomfortable with the concept of \"empathy\" in the medical world because they are taught that \"resistance\" is an integral component of the doctor-patient relationship.
