The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent.

McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping.

The case has been in question since an investigation in 2013 raised questions about whether the trial was unfairly one-sided. The investigation found that the conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. McCullough has insisted that he couldn't have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force. The Illinois State Police began investigating the case again in 2008, after McCullough's half-sister emailed a tip. McCullough was arrested in Seattle and questioned in the case. A judge hearing the case found him not guilty, but the state's attorney filed an appeal that was upheld by the Illinois Appeals Court. The state's attorney now argues that McCullough couldn't have committed the crime as he had an alibi and the physical evidence did not connect him to the crime.<|im_end|>"}

That amounts to each of the 52 cheerleaders getting $2,500 per season worked and $400 per photo shoot. The settlement covers the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. New York State Sen. Diane Savino, per the New York Post, cheered the settlement, calling on the NFL to \"develop uniform rules \u2026 to ensure that all cheerleaders in every state received the employee pay and protections they deserve.\" NFL teams have sought to justify low pay for cheerleaders by saying they're independent contractors, CNN notes. In the case of the Flight Crew, Krystal C.'s suit claimed that cheerleaders were compensated $150 per game and $100 for special appearances. But, when you factor in practices and rehearsals, that pans out to $3.77 per hour. Throw in hair, makeup, and transportation expenses and \"the hourly rate goes below $1.50 an hour,\" says the cheerleaders' attorney. The Flight Crew isn't alone: Cheerleaders have taken to the courts to seek higher pay from the Cincinnati Bengals (tentative agreement reached), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (settled for $825,000), Oakland Raiders (settled for $1.25 million), and the Buffalo Bills (class-action suit on the horizon)."], "response": "In recent news, the New York Jets cheerleaders have settled a lawsuit against the team, in which they alleged that they were underpaid. The lawsuit was filed in 2014 by former cheerleader Krystal C. The deal, worth $325,000, will give each of the 52 cheerleaders $2,500 per season they worked. State Senator Diane Savino urged the Buffalo Bills to do the same.\n\nThe cheerleaders of the Buffalo Bills, known as the Buffalo Jills, have also filed a class-action lawsuit against the team. They claimed they were underpaid and also had to live by a strict code of conduct that dictated their appearance, eating habits, and even how they used feminine products.\n\nState Senator Savino called on the NFL to develop uniform rules for all teams to ensure that cheerleaders are properly paid. Cheerleaders in other NFL teams, such as the Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Oakland Raiders, have also sued their respective teams, alleging low pay and poor working conditions.\n\nThe teams have labeled cheerleaders as independent contractors, claiming that they are not employees. However, the courts have rejected this argument and ruled that cheerleaders are in fact employees. This decision allows the cheerleaders to receive employee benefits such as minimum wage, overtime pay, and unemployment insurance.\n\nIn addition to the wage suits, the cheerleaders have also raised concerns about their working conditions, such as long hours and strict appearance requirements. The lawsuit filed by the Buffalo Jills claims that they were required to attend daily dance practice for several hours and attend at least one game per week, resulting in them working over 40 hours per week without overtime pay or proper compensation.\n\nConclusion:\nThe news highlights the issue of underpayment and poor working conditions for NFL cheerleaders. The Jets cheerleaders have settled their lawsuit for $325,000, while the Buffalo Jills are still pursuing their case. The NFL is urged to develop uniform rules to ensure fair pay and working conditions for all cheerleaders.<|im_end|>"}

Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing.

CDC has been tracking AFM since 2014 when 121 cases were reported, but this year, 32 new cases have been confirmed by the month of July. The disease mainly affects children, with an average age of 7, and most cases recover partially but not fully. The cause of AFM is still not known, with some evidence pointing to an outbreak of enterovirus D68 respiratory infections and a study identifying a particular strain of EV-D68 in the airways of children with AFM. Doctors and health officials are concerned about the rising number of cases and foresee a repeat of 2014, when AFM occurred alongside an outbreak of enterovirus D68 respiratory infections. While the specific cause of AFM is still under investigation, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent severe diseases. No specific treatment has yet been found to markedly improve outcomes, although some doctors have reported that treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) might help, and Prozac could prove beneficial.<|im_end|>"}

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "response": "There are two news passages provided. The first news passage discusses Alexa Internet's donation of their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996. The data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period, containing historical data about websites and web pages. The second news passage is a photograph of a small boy in a caged bed in a residential institution. It was taken in the 1970s and is used to raise awareness about Lumos, a charity that aims to close down institutions for children and orphans. The charity was established after the founder saw the photograph of the small boy and was disturbed by the poor living conditions of children in institutions.\n\nThe second news passage talks about the difficulties faced by children in institutions, particularly those with mental or physical disabilities. These institutions are often where children are taken away from their families due to poverty, lack of education and healthcare facilities, or due to the misconception that the children are orphans. It is a common belief that it is for the best interest of the children to be in institutions rather than with their families. However, scientific research shows that this is not true, as institutionalized children are more likely to be mentally or physically abused, malnourished, and have lower chances of being educated and physically healthy.\n\nThere is a wealth of scientific evidence that institutions cause children measurable and sometimes irreparable harm. Institutionalized children are far less likely to be educated and to be physically or mentally well. Cut off from society, institutionalized children return to the world with their chances of a happy, healthy life greatly impaired, often unable to find employment, excluded from the community, and more likely to enter into a lifetime of poverty and dependency.\n\nInclusive education and healthcare, and support for vulnerable families are crucial in ending the practice of institutionalization. By providing families with the means to provide for their children, institutions can be dismantled, and children can thrive within their own families and communities. International donors play a vital role in this regard, and the end of institutionalization is a solvable problem. Lumos estimates that it can be eradicated globally by 2050. The news suggests that the organisation has achieved great success in reducing the number of children in institutions, and they aim to end institutionalization in their lifetime.\n\nIt is evident that the news pieces discuss the inhuman conditions in institutions, the difficulties faced by children in such institutions, and the detrimental effects of institutionalization.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres.

The company had indicated earlier in the day that it may also have to reduce its dividend, the Wall Street Journal reports. Dudley is set to receive the full bonus he was eligible for, which comes to $4.2 million (including $1.4 million in cash and a portion in deferred BP shares), per an earlier MarketWatch report. This amount was bumped up from the $3 million ($1 million in cash) he received in 2014. BP's CFO was also on the list to rake in his full bonus. \"We think it sends the wrong message,\" a rep for shareholder Royal London Asset Management tells the BBC. \"It shows that the board is out of touch.\" Not only did BP suffer straight-up monetary losses as the price of oil fell, it also announced it will be getting rid of about 7,000 jobs and taking other belt-tightening measures. And the Financial Times notes that other energy company execs saw their pay slashed in 2015. But a BP spokesman says \"executives performed strongly in a difficult environment in 2015, managing the things they could control and for which they were accountable.\" Andy Critchlow, writing for the Reuters Breakingviews blog, agrees. \"Dudley has to work harder than his predecessors,\" he writes, noting the CEO has helped the company recover from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and improved safety protocol. \"The mild-mannered American has had possibly the toughest job in the oil industry. His rewards look in line with that task.\" Carl-Henric Svanberg, chairman of BP's board, says the nonbinding shareholder vote won't alter the payouts they've already decided on, but that the board will take investors' concerns into account when coming up with next year's compensation packages."], "response": "BP PLC, an energy company, faced opposition from some shareholders for handing its chief executive, Bob Dudley, a 20% increase in his total remuneration package for 2015, despite the company's $5.2 billion loss that year. The opposition was due to the fact that it was hard to square the amount with the company's financial performance. However, the CEO had to work harder than his predecessors due to the current oil market being more challenging. The company's leadership has managed to deliver decent returns when compared to peers, and since the Gulf of Mexico disaster last year, the number of recorded oil spills and employee injuries have both been at a five-year low. Moreover, the company's CEO has also succeeded in changing the company's culture, which was tainted by safety concerns and excessive risk-taking. However, a shareholder advisory group criticized the company's decision to award its top directors their maximum bonuses for 2015, despite the company's lackluster performance. The group also recommended shareholders to vote against the payment plans. In response, the company's spokesman stated that safety and operational risk performance was excellent, and the company responded quickly and decisively to the drop in oil prices.<|im_end|>"}

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

The Pacific Crest Trail Association is experiencing an increased number of inquiries and requests for permits for long-distance hikes on the trail, particularly due to the popularity of the movie \"Wild.\" Despite the increased demand, the PCTA has implemented a quota system to prevent overcrowding and to maintain the quality of the hiking experience. Permits are now limited to 50 per day during the high season, and there is also a limit on the number of permits that can be issued each year.\n\nThe third passage discusses the history and impact of the Pacific Crest Trail on the environment and trail communities. The trail stretches over 2,650 miles from California to Washington, and has only been completed by 3,346 people since its inception in the 1950s. In recent years, the number of hikers on the trail has increased significantly, particularly due to the popularity of the book and movie \"Wild.\" The environmental impact of the increased number of hikers has led to concerns about overcrowding and environmental damage, and there are also real financial costs to the trail communities.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes\u2014similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes. (A study postulated that nearly all dinosaurs had feathers.)"], "response": "A team of scientists from China has announced the discovery of a new species of dinosaur that lived in the Late Jurassic period, around 161 million years ago. The new species, named Caihong juji, has been described as a small theropod with crow-sized body, long snout and sharp teeth, similar to a Velociraptor. It had colorful feathers that were iridescent and resembled the colors of a rainbow, with rainbow feathers covering its head, neck and chest. Caihong had unique features, such as crests above its eyes that looked like bony eyebrows.\n\nThe scientists used powerful microscopes to examine the fossil and found that it had the remains of organelles called melanosomes responsible for pigmentation. The shape of the melanosomes determined the colors of the feathers. The researchers found that Caihong's feathers had pancake-shaped melanosomes, similar to those of hummingbirds with iridescent feathers. The dinosaur had dark feathers on much of its body, but it had ribbon-like iridescent feathers on its head and neck.\n\nThe researchers also found that Caihong was much more different from the other theropods of its time, such as Anchiornis huxleyi, Xiaotingia zhengi, Eosinopteryx brevipenna, and Aurornis xui. Caihong had a shallow skull, antorbital fenestra much longer anteroposteriorly than high dorsoventrally, and much shorter caudal vertebral series, among other features.\n\nIt is speculated that Caihong may have glided through the air and hunted small mammals and lizards. The discovery of Caihong provides new insights into the evolution of birds and their characteristics. The researchers also suggest that there was a more colorful Jurassic World than previously imagined.\n\nCaihong's full scientific name is Caihong juji, which means \"rainbow with a big crest.\" The skeleton of the animal is preserved on a slab and counter slab, in the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning, in northern Hebei Province, and was found in the Tiaojishan Formation in Gangou, Qinglong.<|im_end|>"}

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles\u2014$15.99\u2014and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let\u2019s be clear. Soda taxes don\u2019t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue\u2014they drive it outside city limits. They don\u2019t help ease inequality\u2014they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide. (Speaking of Seattle and beverages, the world's largest Starbucks is no longer located there.)"], "response": "In Seattle, a 1.75% tax on sweetened beverages was imposed to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for important projects, and subsidize healthy food for low-income families. However, this tax faced opposition due to its regressive nature, driving away customers, and not making people healthier. Before the tax was imposed, former Mayor Ed Murray hailed it as a \"cutting edge piece of legislation\" and considered it one of his greatest accomplishments, setting an example for the nation.\n\nHowever, Cook County in Illinois repealed its soda tax within two months after a tremendous public outcry due to the tax's negative impact on businesses and the poor. In Seattle, the tax is especially burdensome, with a case of Gatorade costing over $30 due to the tax. Despite the tax being meant to reduce sugar consumption, drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient are exempt from the tax, leaving Starbucks to reject it.\n\nOn the other hand, a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University revealed that three of the top five states with the most paternalistic laws are California, Oregon, and Washington, which often lead to social engineering.\n\nThe content includes a narrative summary of events, issues, and perspectives of the news articles related to the sugary beverage tax in Seattle and Illinois.

According to the sources, Nicole is partying heavily and is not taking proper precautions to avoid the risk of FAS.\n\nThe Fetal Alcohol Syndrome has been recognized since the 1970s, and it is caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy.

As soldiers surround the vehicle, its occupants exit and are forced to lie down in front of the car. Soldiers are then seen dragging a suspect to the same spot.

The military originally stated that in the May 3 encounter, the fuel thieves used local residents as human shields in an initial ambush on an army patrol, leading to the death of two soldiers and a third wounding. However, the government later retracted its statement, and the military did not provide any further details on the incident.\n\nThe Mexican National Human Rights Commission has called for a swift and thorough investigation into the events depicted in both videos. The military has been implicated in extrajudicial killings before, with the killing of 22 suspects at a warehouse in the Mexico state community of Tlatlaya being a prominent example. The army's reputation has been damaged by numerous scandals, leading to calls for reforms.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The study finds that people under 50 are more likely to have advanced stage cancer and to undergo more aggressive treatments such as surgery and radiation therapy. The study suggests that younger people are often diagnosed only after their cancers start to cause symptoms and that doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits, and pain when going to the bathroom.\n\nIn the fourth news passage, a study published in the journal Cancer has found that colon cancer rates are rising among men and women under 50, the age at which guidelines recommend screenings start. The study finds that people under 50 are more likely to have advanced stage cancer and to undergo more aggressive treatments such as surgery and radiation therapy. The study suggests that smoking, obesity, and a poor diet may be contributing factors to the increase in colon cancer among younger adults.

The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"\u2014an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience\u2014to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "response": "Three new studies have been published that shed light on the development of Homo sapiens, or our close evolutionary relatives, during the Middle Stone Age in East Africa. The studies suggest that dramatic shifts in the climate drove toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among Homo species around 320,000 years ago. Newly excavated Middle Stone Age tools and red pigment chunks from the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya indicate that Homo species responded to climate change by foraging over larger areas with increasingly smaller tools. Back-and-forth shifts between wet and dry conditions from around 315,000 years ago to 320,000 years ago coincided with the emergence of Homo sapiens and the development of obsidian tools, which were made from material that came from far away. The studies suggest that early Homo sapiens and their relatives evolved to deal with constantly changing environments, and that the emergence of Homo sapiens was driven by factors such as climate change, population pressures, and the need to adapt to new ecological niches.\n\nClimate change and population pressures are likely to have played a significant role in the emergence of Homo sapiens, as the study of the Middle Stone Age tools at Olorgesailie suggests. The ancient toolmaking approaches varied greatly from one part of Africa to another, with hominids employing diverse mixes of old-school chopping tools and newer, sharp points. The transition from the African Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age is increasingly being attributed to cultural, rather than genetic, factors. The Middle Stone Age is characterized by the absence or rarity of large cutting tools and the presence of prepared core technologies for making sophisticated points and blades, which are associated with archaic rather than modern human fossils.<|im_end|>"}

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today.

(Avianca), and many of Avianca's affiliates to form a joint business agreement (JBA). The agreement is expected to provide substantial benefits for customers, communities, and the marketplace for air travel between the United States and 19 countries in Central and South America. The JBA will integrate Copa and Avianca's route networks and will offer customers many benefits such as integrated, seamless service, new nonstop routes, additional flights on existing routes, and reduced travel times. The JBA is expected to drive significant traffic growth at major gateway cities coast to coast and will bring new investment and create more economic development opportunities. The JBA is expected to provide customers with expanded codeshare flight options, competitive fares, a more streamlined travel experience, and better customer service. Additionally, the three carriers will be able to serve customers as if they were a single airline.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The study provides evidence that Mars was once habitable and suggests that life may have emerged on the planet.\n\nThe second news passage highlights an ancient ocean that covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, showing that the planet was a wet world in its youth, with long-standing lakes, winding river deltas, and standing water. The evidence supports the idea that Mars was at least habitable in the distant past and suggests that life might have originated or proliferated on the planet.\n\nThe third news passage reports on new findings suggesting that an ocean at least a mile deep once covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface four billion years ago.

Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters. The brand name itself of \"KitKat\" is not being contested. (Atari accused Nestle of ripping off one of its popular video games in an ad for KitKat.)"], "response": "In a long-running legal battle between global chocolate giants, the European Court of Justice has dismissed appeals by both companies and sent the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The ruling means that the EUIPO must review a 2012 decision that upheld Nestle's trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit, known as KitKat. The court found that Nestle had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive. However, the outcome leaves open the possibility that the trademark agency could, while respecting the judges' ruling, take account of other evidence and preserve protection for KitKat's shape. The brand name \"KitKat\" is not at issue in the case. The dispute has implications for brands operating across the EU single market and has featured in Britain's Brexit debate. A separate case in Britain also involves the Americans' Cadbury and the shade of purple used to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.<|im_end|>"}

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. \u201cA cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,\u201d says the lead author. \u201cThat suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture. (Scientists have grown chickens with dinosaur legs.)"], "response": "Recent research has suggested that the Tyrannosaurus Rex did not roar as fearsome as portrayed in popular movies. The roar was found to be a fictional element created in a sound studio using a combination of baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and alligator gargles. The research further found that dinosaurs might have produced a variety of sounds similar to today's birds, including the cooing of pigeons and ostriches, as well as lower, throaty sounds. The study's lead author, Chad Eliason, indicated that \"closed-mouth behavior evolved many times\" and \"can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays.\"\n\nAnother news article discussed a collection of web pages, including those from the ISKME.org and IGC.org websites, which are now available for public viewing. The collection, curated by Mark Graham, covers web captures of dinosaur research sites and could shed light on the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds.\n\nThe third news article investigated the use of closed-mouth vocalization in birds, finding that it is predominantly used in large-bodied lineages, such as ostriches, cassowaries, and doves, as opposed to small-bodied passerines. Closed-mouth vocalizations generate resonance conditions that favor low-frequency sounds, and birds making these vocalizations usually do so only to attract mates or defend their territory. The study's authors suggest that dinosaurs, specifically those with large body sizes, may have used closed-mouth vocalization behavior during sexually selected vocal displays, but there is no direct fossil evidence of what dinosaurs sounded like.\n\nFinally, the article investigates the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and related outgroups. Closed-mouth vocalizations are rare in small-bodied passerines but occur in diverse archosaur species, including crocodiles and birds. The study's authors propose that closed-mouth vocalization can emerge in diverse archosaur species depending on behavioral or environmental circumstances, indicating that this behavior may have been present in at least some extinct non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nIn summary, recent research suggests that the T. rex did not roar as fearsome as portrayed in movies and that dinosaurs might have produced sounds similar to today's birds, with a variety of vocalizations available depending on the body size and type of animal.<|im_end|>"}

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure?

Here's what you need to know: Benghazi is \"unlikely to be a potent tool for weakening Clinton\" in the general election, as the committee and report have little credibility and aren't seen as serious by many, the Los Angeles Times reports. Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of \u201cculpability or wrongdoing\u201d on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being \u201cone of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. \u201cThe Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board."], "response": "The latest news revolves around the report released by the Benghazi Select Committee. The report reveals that officials from the State Department and the White House knew that the attack on the US mission in Benghazi was not related to a protest over an anti-Islamic video, as previously stated by the Obama administration. The report suggests that officials were aware of concerns about the uniforms of US Marines being deployed in the region, as well as questions about the clothing of US officials. The report also reveals that officials from the State Department discussed the possibility of US Marines wearing civilian clothing instead of uniforms to avoid diplomatic issues in the region.\n\nIn another passage, it is mentioned that the US government is working to determine the precise motives and methods of those who carried out the Benghazi attack. Additionally, the news highlights the contrast between the public and private statements made by officials, with the public statements portraying the attack as a protest over an anti-Islamic video, while the private statements acknowledge that it was a terrorist attack. The report further emphasizes that the Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack and its consequences.<|im_end|>"}

The former Louisa County Sheriff's Office detective, Buck Garner, testified that a police bloodhound detected traces of Hannah Graham at an industrial site about a mile from downtown Charlottesville.\n\nIn the second news passage, the court ruled that the search warrants should have been granted and approved the hiring of a mental health expert to examine Matthew before his trial. The defense attorney argues that the dog's findings were inconsistent with witness accounts and surveillance footage, and that there was no probable cause for the search warrant. Witness statements put Hannah Graham and Jesse Matthew together that night, and Matthew bought them drinks at a bar on the Downtown Mall.<|im_end|>"}

Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "response": "The world faces a growing obesity problem, with close to a third of the population either obese or overweight.

The problem is particularly severe in developing countries, with more than two-thirds of the obese population residing there.\n\nCauses of Obesity:\nThe causes of obesity are complex and multifaceted, and the latest study reveals new information about the problem. The researchers found that obesity is fueled by an array of factors, including the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, and salty junk food, changes in diet composition, and sedentary lifestyles.\n\nMoreover, the study found that changes in the mix of bacteria that live in human guts, referred to as the gut microbiota, may play a role in the development of obesity. The latest study highlights the need for action to tackle the root causes of obesity and prevent it from becoming an even bigger health crisis.\n\nThe Impact of Obesity:\nObesity is a major risk factor for a range of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain types of cancer.
