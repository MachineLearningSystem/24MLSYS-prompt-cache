The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent. While the judge Friday vacated McCullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the Chicago Tribune reports. McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping.

She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "response": "Passage 1: Alexa Internet has been donating its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, which is then added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.\nPassage 2: A black-and-white photograph in a newspaper showed a small boy locked in a caged bed in a residential institution.

The passage notes that the remake of the movie focuses on the struggles of Benicio Del Toro to perform the role previously portrayed by Lon Chaney Jr. However, Del Toro is unable to match Chaney's performance, which the passage attributes to the actor's inability to match Chaney's emotional connection with the role. The director, Joe Johnston, attempted to create a bridge between the restrained Universal horror movies and modern-day horror movies, but the resulting film is hampered by poor makeup and a lack of emotional connection from the actors.\nPassage 2 criticizes the film for being visually beautiful and having a lot of potential, but failing to deliver on its promise. The film's dark atmosphere, moody pacing, and the occasional suggestion that a feral beast may be lurking within are all present, but it ultimately falls short as it is reduced to a gruesome fondue and actors resort to actorly ham and studio cheese.

BP's CFO was also on the list to rake in his full bonus. \"We think it sends the wrong message,\" a rep for shareholder Royal London Asset Management tells the BBC. \"It shows that the board is out of touch.\" Not only did BP suffer straight-up monetary losses as the price of oil fell, it also announced it will be getting rid of about 7,000 jobs and taking other belt-tightening measures. And the Financial Times notes that other energy company execs saw their pay slashed in 2015. But a BP spokesman says \"executives performed strongly in a difficult environment in 2015, managing the things they could control and for which they were accountable.\" Andy Critchlow, writing for the Reuters Breakingviews blog, agrees. \"Dudley has to work harder than his predecessors,\" he writes, noting the CEO has helped the company recover from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and improved safety protocol. \"The mild-mannered American has had possibly the toughest job in the oil industry. His rewards look in line with that task.\" Carl-Henric Svanberg, chairman of BP's board, says the nonbinding shareholder vote won't alter the payouts they've already decided on, but that the board will take investors' concerns into account when coming up with next year's compensation packages."], "response": "BP faces opposition from some shareholders for awarding Chief Executive Bob Dudley a 20% increase in his total remuneration package for 2015 to $19.6 million. The increase was criticized by proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, which suggested that Dudley's payout was not fully justified by the company's performance. BP's shareholders voted against the company's pay decisions for the first time in living memory, with 59% of proxy votes cast going against BP's decision to pay Dudley nearly $20m for 2015. The rebellion highlighted a growing trend of institutional investors and advisers around the world taking a more aggressive stance over pay. Another shareholder, Royal London Asset Management, also criticized Dudley's pay deal, calling it \"out of touch\". The oil giant was left scrambling to win back support of some of the City's biggest institutions. The increase in Dudley's pay was despite the company running up a $5.2 billion loss in 2015. The rebellion also signaled a concern over the company's dividend policy, and the company is signaling that it may have to reduce its dividend, as low oil prices continue to threaten the once-sacrosanct investor payouts across the industry.<|im_end|>"}

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

The article discusses the recent increase in permit applications and the implementation of a permit quota system to limit the number of hikers on the trail. The quota system is designed to spread out hikers over a longer period of time and to protect the environment from damage.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes\u2014similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles\u2014$15.99\u2014and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let\u2019s be clear. Soda taxes don\u2019t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue\u2014they drive it outside city limits. They don\u2019t help ease inequality\u2014they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide. (Speaking of Seattle and beverages, the world's largest Starbucks is no longer located there.)"], "response": "Seattle imposed a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages, which was supposed to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue, and subsidize healthy food purchases. However, the tax was met with opposition, as it was considered regressive and did not result in the desired reduction of sugar consumption or increased revenue. The tax also did not unite the city around its goals, with various groups opposing it, such as labor unions, businesses, and individuals. The soda tax was not effective in raising revenue and was driving it outside of Seattle. Businesses were responding to the tax by changing their business locations to areas without the tax. Cook County, Illinois repealed its soda tax due to its negative impact on the local economy. The west coast is known for its social engineering policies, but a study revealed that three of the top five states with the most paternalistic laws are California, Oregon, and Washington.\n\nAnother news passage discussed the impact of Seattle's sugary beverage tax on Costco. The tax increased the price of sweetened beverages, which prompted Costco to change their prices and inform customers of the tax. The tax was considered burdensome, with customers seeing drastic increases in prices for drinks in bulk. However, Starbucks rejected the tax.\n\nA third news passage discussed the impact of the Cook County sweetened beverage tax and the subsequent repeal of the tax. The tax was met with opposition from various groups, including the beverage industry, retailers, and restaurants. The tax was considered regressive and did not result in the desired reduction of sugar consumption or increased revenue. The tax was not effective in raising revenue and was driving it outside of Cook County.\n\nThe fourth news passage discussed a bill being re-introduced to bring the statewide sugary drink tax in Washington state. The proposed tax would add nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold, with the money raised being used to fund a program that provides healthy meals for low-income families.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month\u2014and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "response": "NASA has announced its newest mission, the Parker Solar Probe, that will attempt to get close to the sun's surface to study its atmosphere. The spacecraft, which was formerly known as the Solar Probe Plus mission, will now be named after solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted a high-speed solar wind. The mission is expected to launch in summer 2018. The probe will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun. Instruments on board the spacecraft will probe myriad solar phenomena, including the electric and magnetic properties of the sun\u2019s plasma, counting and catching the components of solar wind. NASA scientists hope to find out why the sun's corona is so much hotter than its surface and improve space weather forecasting. Parker Solar Probe will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion or the closest point to the sun. The spacecraft will then repeat that flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025.\n\nPassage 1: \nThe Parker Solar Probe is the latest mission from NASA, aimed at studying the sun.

The Department of Homeland Security recently sent retailers and financial service companies a secret memo warning that the Target hit appeared to be part of a larger international campaign, the Wall Street Journal reports, an insight gleaned with the help of Dallas cybersecurity firm iSight Partners. Yesterday, iSight released its own report, saying that a virus it's calling KAPTOXA \"has potentially infected a large number of retail information systems\"\u2014and noting that the \"intrusion operators displayed innovation and a high degree of skill,\" particularly in terms of the \"operational sophistication\" of the hack. The Journal shares this feature by way of example: The virus focused on stealing data during the peak hours of 10am and 5pm; the data was housed in a Target server that the hackers later accessed. The virus attacks point-of-sale systems in a way that is \"new to eCrime,\" subverting traditional efforts to protect consumer data, the report warns, according to NBC. Parts of the code, which is impervious to all known antivirus software, have been online since last spring. It's partly in Russian, which US officials think may indicate a link to organized crime in the former Soviet Union. The finding follows reports of similar breaches at Neiman Marcus. That breach had gone unnoticed since July, the New York Times reports today; Neiman's system was only fully secured Sunday."], "response": "A computer firm hired to investigate a massive data breach at Target stores has revealed new information about the hack that endangered data for over 100 million customers during the holiday season. The report, filed to the U.S. Secret Service and obtained by NBC News, states that the attack was caused by a type of malware known as \"skimming,\" which targets the memory of cash register systems and retrieves encrypted card data. The sophistication of the attack makes it one of the most significant cyber crimes in recent years.\n\nThe report also highlights that the malware used in the attack was developed in regions such as Russia and Brazil. It works by exploiting a system's vulnerability, which allows it to covertly access data and evade network controls and forensic techniques. The report highlights that since POS hacking offers significant advantages over other methods, we can expect more of these types of attacks in the future.\n\nNeiman Marcus, another retailer, also suffered a data breach that began in July and was only fully contained on Sunday. The company initially concealed the breach until a journalist, Brian Krebs, revealed it to the public. The incident highlights the importance of notifying customers promptly when there is a security breach.\n\nThe Target data breach was the result of an international hacking campaign, as per a report from federal and private investigators sent to financial-services companies and retailers. The report indicates that the hackers are skilled and ingenious, and that the operation poses a significant threat to the industry. The authorities are investigating the connection between the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches, as they both appear to have been carried out by Eastern European criminal groups.\n\nIn conclusion, the Target data breach has highlighted the severity of cyber crime, particularly during the holiday season. The breach caused by POS malware demonstrates that retailers are not immune to such attacks, and we can expect more of them in the future. It is crucial for companies to adopt robust cybersecurity measures and inform customers promptly when there is a security breach.<|im_end|>"}

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)\u2014which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation\u2014yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

Photo: A study shows that people with coronary artery disease who experience rapidly losing and regaining weight, known as \"yo-yo\" dieting, have a higher risk of deadly heart attacks and strokes.\n2. The study, sponsored by Pfizer, followed 9,509 men and women with coronary artery disease for an average of 12 years and found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78% higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n3. The study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, recommends losing weight but stresses the importance of keeping it off.\n4.

A healthy lifestyle can help prevent and treat coronary artery disease.\n6. Coronary artery disease care is available at Mayo Clinic.\n7. Past studies have linked yo-yo dieting with an increased risk of poor heart health, but this new research finds that the health consequences of repeatedly losing and gaining weight may be more severe for people with pre-existing heart disease.\n8. Researchers found that people with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at a much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than those who experienced little change in body weight.\n9. Lead study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore and colleagues recently reported their results in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n10. Yo-yo dieting is defined as repeated cycles of weight loss and weight gain.\n11. A number of studies have documented the possible health risks of yo-yo dieting, including one reported last year that uncovered a link between weight cycling and greater risk of death from heart disease.\n12. This new research builds on those findings, revealing how yo-yo dieting may impact the health of individuals who have pre-existing coronary heart disease.\n13. Coronary heart disease is the most common form of heart disease among men and women in the United States, and each year it kills more than 370,000 people.\n14.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed\u2014or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed. (Ninety rocks in Australia could rank up there with Stonehenge.)"], "response": "Archaeologists have discovered an ancient settlement dating back 49,000 years in a rock shelter in southern Australia.

The site contains evidence of human interaction with mega fauna, including the largest marsupial ever known. The discovery has important implications for understanding the earliest human presence in Australia, and it could suggest that humans arrived much earlier than previously thought.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "response": "Three new studies have been published in the journal Science, exploring the discovery of stone age tools in Kenya that were made by early humans around 320,000 years ago. The study discovered that these tools were used for chopping down branches or large animals, and the next technological revolution, marking the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, happened ten times earlier than previously thought. The scientists believe that the region's environmental and climatic changes that occurred around 800,000 years ago, made it difficult for early humans to find food, and that they adapted to this by becoming more mobile, gathering more information, and sharing it with neighboring communities. The researchers found that the earliest Middle Stone Age industry in East Africa was used for making sharp points and blades that were made on obsidian from over 25 km away.<|im_end|>"}

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones.

The Canadian government has rejected Russia's request, arguing that it will never recognize Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine.

Four board members will vote after the hearing and Simpson could be free by Oct. 1 if they are all in favor of parole. If Simpson is indeed released this fall\u2014which appears almost certainly to be the decision\u2014it will \"renew the rabid curiosity\" in the case and \"produce a spectacle unlike anything we\u2019ve seen since he went behind bars,\" Nancy Armour at USA Today predicts. There has even been talk that Simpson might end up with a reality TV show, but Armour wants Simpson to avoid the spotlight unless he wants to return to the \"toxic mentality that landed him in prison in the first place.\" If the former NFL star does end up with a TV show, the money is likely to go to the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, CBS News reports. He will still receive an NFL pension estimated at $25,000 per month."], "response": "On Oct. 3, 1995, a jury acquitted Orenthal James \"O.J.\" Simpson of the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Simpson's case was considered one of the most famous trials in American history, drawing in millions of viewers. Almost two decades later, Simpson is currently in prison for an entirely different crime. He is scheduled to appear before a Nevada judge on Thursday to make his case for parole. If granted, he could be released as soon as Oct. 1. The ex-football star has little money left and has been living on his NFL pension. His net worth was estimated to be $10.8 million in 1992, but has since decreased significantly. The divorce settlement revealed that Simpson was earning $55,000 per month in 1992, more than $97,000 in May 2017 dollars. However, much of this money came from car rental company Hertz, where Simpson served as their spokesperson for nearly 20 years, earning $550,000 per year. Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman, were found stabbed to death outside her Brentwood condominium in June 1994. Simpson was charged with their murders, and his case became known as the \"Trial of the Century.\" Simpson was acquitted of the murders, but was later found liable for the deaths in a civil suit brought by the Brown and Goldman families in 1997. Simpson was also found guilty of armed robbery and kidnapping in a separate case in 2007.\n\nIf Simpson is granted parole, he could be released from prison as early as Oct. 1. Simpson's behavior in prison has been good, and his parole would likely be granted on the basis of his age, which is considered a mitigating factor. However, the Brown and Goldman families have not been able to collect the full judgment against Simpson, despite the fact that they cannot touch his NFL pension.<|im_end|>"}

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Certain basins and orographic depressions show even higher enrichment, while high altitude regions show much lower values (1 to 3 VSMOW).

Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

One of the individuals who died was an 8-year-old boy named Martin Richard, from Dorchester, Massachusetts. The other two individuals who were killed were identified as Krystle Campbell, a restaurant manager from Medford, Massachusetts, and a Chinese graduate student from Boston University who was in the United States on a student visa.\n\nFollowing the bombings, FBI officials stated that there were no known additional threats. The Boston Mayor, Thomas Menino, said that the city would \"pull together\" in the face of the tragedy. The University of Massachusetts Boston released a statement expressing condolences for the Richard family and offering prayers for the families of the other victims.\n\nSeveral vigils and memorial services were held in memory of the victims.\n\nAccording to media reports, two brothers were charged with using explosives and a car to carry out the attack. The brothers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, were both killed in a shootout with police on April 19, 2013.\n\nPresident Barack Obama addressed the nation from the White House and said that the U.S. would \"never give in to terror.\" Governor Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency and closed the Massachusetts Turnpike from the Rhode Island border to the New Hampshire border.\n\nThe investigation into the bombings led to the discovery of a vehicle suspected to be involved in the attack, as well as evidence that the suspects had traveled to Russia and obtained bomb-making materials there. The suspects were eventually identified as Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who were ethnic Chechen refugees living in the United States. They were arrested on April 18, 2013, and were found guilty of participating in the bombings in 2015.<|im_end|>"}

The 188-country study found that there are 2.1 billion overweight or obese people in the world, making up around 30% of the world's population, up from 20% in 1980, USA Today reports. Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "response": "The first news passage explains that obesity is a growing problem worldwide, affecting both rich and poor countries. The article discusses how the rate of obesity is increasing among men, women, and children in both developed and developing countries. The second news passage reports that a comprehensive study has been conducted covering 188 nations, from 1980 to 2013, to understand the global obesity problem. The study shows that the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands have staggeringly high obesity rates. Obesity rates are higher in developed countries compared to poor countries, but it is rising in both. The study notes that population-wide weight gains and income gains go hand in hand around the world, suggesting that obesity is a major health issue fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, and salty food, and sedentary lifestyles. There is no single country that has been successful in reducing obesity rates. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions.<|im_end|>"}

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "response": "Egyptians are currently participating in the final round of voting for the third phase of parliamentary elections. The Muslim Brotherhood is expected to consolidate its gains, with its Freedom and Justice party expected to take the lead. However, some analysts are skeptical of the party's anticipated victory due to the unclear formula for allocating seats among parties based on their share of the vote. The elections come amidst growing opposition to the ruling military council, which is viewed as hindering the transition to a more democratic system.\n\nThere has been a decline in economic growth, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% in the first 11 months of 2011. The stock market has also performed poorly, with the EGX 30 losing 49% in value last year, making it one of the three worst-performing stock markets worldwide. This has led to a decline in tourist numbers, which has been a major source of foreign exchange.\n\nThe trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has begun, with the prosecution accusing him of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression. The court has so far shown footage of Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a stretcher, and the prosecution has argued that he was responsible for the deaths of at least 846 people during the 18-day revolution.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood has made a bid to form a majority government, but it has been met with skepticism and concern from liberal and leftist parties. The Brotherhood has rejected calls for an all-Islamist government and has emphasized its commitment to forming a coalition or unity government with other parties.\n\nThere has been uncertainty over the role that the new parliament will play in Egypt's political future, with many concerned about the military council's intentions.<|im_end|>"}
