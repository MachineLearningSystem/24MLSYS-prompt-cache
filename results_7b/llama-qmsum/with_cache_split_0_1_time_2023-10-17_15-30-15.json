The Industrial Designer mentioned that the group had discussed the financial constraints and agreed not to include certain features due to budget constraints. However, the User Interface did not seem to agree with this, suggesting that they had not been involved in the discussion or did not remember it correctly.\n2. During the discussion of the remote's design, the User Interface expressed some concerns about the button placement and the overall look of the device. The Industrial Designer replied that they had considered these factors during the design process but ultimately decided on a different approach. While there does not appear to be a major disagreement between the two, there is a subtle difference in their perspectives on the design.\n3. When the User Interface asked the Industrial Designer if they had seen any other songs, the Industrial Designer responded that they had not.
