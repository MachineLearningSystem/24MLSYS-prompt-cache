Therefore, they were calling for the possibility of losing the law for those who did have something to do with childcare and education."], "response": "Vaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation program for the flu as well. We know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales\u2014a child who's in critical care\u2014but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply\u2014that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the positives in this condition.

He would likely agree that the evaluation of the legitimacy of the children's rights, protection and demands is crucial in ensuring that the response to the pandemic is proportionate and respects the rights of all individuals, including children.\nIn summary, Albert Heaney would likely view the Coronavirus Act as a necessary measure to protect public health, but also recognise that the impact"}

First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce."], "response": "Kirsty Williams AM said that the trend of teacher recruitment is not unique to Wales but is a global issue. She cited the example of the Atlantic Rim system-to-system conference where she met with education systems from different parts of the world and found that they are also facing the same issue. The reasons for this trend include financial incentives, but it is not the sole cause. Other factors include employment-based routes into qualified teacher status, diversity in the teaching workforce, and the dynamic brought by different experiences and perspectives. Wales is taking steps to address this issue by increasing the number of places on part-time PGCE routes, supporting the unique part-time PGCE route, and keeping an eye on the situation regarding the pay dispute. Additionally, she expressed her desire to work with colleagues across the UK to find a UK-wide solution to the problem.</s>"}

They discussed the importance of considering the younger generation's preferences for soft materials and bright colors, and how to balance these preferences with the cost and ease of use of the product. They also reviewed the different concepts and ideas presented by the industrial designer, including the use of a scroll wheel and the placement of buttons on the remote control. The team also discussed the importance of keeping the design small and compact, while still providing easy access to the buttons and features of the remote control. Additionally, they reviewed the costs and feasibility of using different types of batteries and chips, and how to balance these considerations with the overall design of the product.</s>"}
