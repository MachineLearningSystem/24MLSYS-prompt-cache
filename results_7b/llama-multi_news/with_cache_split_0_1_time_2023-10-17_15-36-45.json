According to CBS News, 76-year-old Jack McCullough was convicted of kidnapping a 7-year-old girl, choking her, and stabbing her to death in 1957. The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent. While the judge Friday vacated McCullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the Chicago Tribune reports. McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents\u2014including phone and Air Force records\u2014supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened. But his was the only non-yearbook photo in the lineup, and she picked a different man out of a photo lineup 50 years earlier. That info wasn't allowed at McCullough's trial either. No physical evidence was ever found to support McCullough's conviction."], "response": "In Sycamore, Illinois, Jack McCullough was released from prison after serving 50 years for the 1957 abduction and murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. McCullough's conviction was overturned due to new evidence that confirmed his alibi and pointed to his innocence. The evidence included phone records that showed McCullough was in Rockford, Illinois, at the time of the abduction, and newly discovered documents that supported his claim that he was attempting to enlist in the US Air Force. The case against McCullough was originally built on the testimony of Maria's friend, who identified him as the killer in an array of six photographs. However, the friend's identification was based on a partial view of McCullough's face, as everyone else in the array was wearing a suitcoat. The case against McCullough was also based on improperly barred evidence, including police reports and a wealth of information pointing to his innocence. The release of McCullough raises questions about whether the courtroom reconstruction of history was unfairly one-sided and highlights the difficulty of prosecuting cold cases, where evidence is often lost or destroyed, memories fade, and witnesses die. The case is likely to reopen old wounds for Maria's family, who remain convinced of McCullough's guilt and have sought the appointment of a special prosecutor to keep him behind bars. </s>"}

But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia. (The latest antibiotic-resistant bug to make headlines is a nasty stomach virus.)"], "response": "Two studies have been conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, which shed light on the effects of cigarette smoke on bacteria, particularly the superbug MRSA. The first study discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke alters MRSA's cell walls, making it more resistant to reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. Specifically, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The study also found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls.\n\n\nIn addition, the study found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. The second study conducted by the same team found that cigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract become harder to kill. The study also found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA became better at invading human cells in lab cultures. The researchers concluded that the study suggests that cigarette smoke makes the bacteria tougher and more resistant to the host's immune system.\n\n\nThe results of these studies suggest that cigarette smoke may play a role in the development and progression of infectious diseases, particularly in smokers. The studies provide further evidence that smoking is harmful to both smokers and non-smokers, as cigarette smoke can increase the resistance of bacteria to the host's immune system, making them more difficult to treat. These findings could lead to further research into the effects of cigarette smoke on the immune system and the development of infectious diseases. </s>"}

Malaysia police has identified the suspects as two women, one Vietnamese and one Indonesian, who are currently in custody. The nerve agent, VX, was detected in swabs taken from Kim's eyes and face. VX is a potent and persistent chemical weapon that can cause death within minutes of exposure. It is illegal and banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention, which North Korea never signed. North Korea is suspected of having the capacity to produce up to 4,500 metric tons of chemical weapons during a typical year, which it could increase to 12,000 tons per year during a period of crisis. There are concerns that North Korea might use chemical weapons against South Korea, potentially threatening the lives of millions. In this case, Malaysia has three people in custody, including the two suspected attackers, and is seeking several other people including the second secretary of North Korea's embassy in Kuala Lumpur and an employee of North Korea's state-owned airline, Air Koryo. The case has marked a serious turnaround in relations between Malaysia and North Korea, and has raised questions about public safety in Malaysia, particularly at the airport where Kim Jong-nam was killed. </s>"}

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes\u2014similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The discovery has provided new insights into the evolution of feathers, with the finding that the feathers of Caihong had pancake-shaped melanosomes, similar to those of hummingbirds, which gave it a rainbow-like appearance. Caihong also had a unique crest on its head, similar to that of a Velociraptor, and was known for its flashy display, which may have been used for social or sexual cues.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles\u2014$15.99\u2014and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let\u2019s be clear.

However, the tax has been met with opposition from businesses and consumers, who are feeling the pinch of the higher prices. In fact, some have been shopping outside of the city to avoid the tax.\nCostco, a large retailer, has seen a significant increase in the price of soda and other beverages due to the tax, with some products increasing in price by nearly 70%. The company has responded by changing its price signs to reflect the new tax and informing customers where they can find similar products at lower prices outside of the city.\nThe repeal of Cook County, Illinois' sugary beverage tax has been celebrated by the beverage industry, which spent millions fighting the tax, and retailers who saw sales dwindle and customers stray across county lines since the tax was implemented in August. The tax was originally intended to reduce sugar consumption and raise revenue for healthy food programs, but it has been met with controversy and criticism from the start.\nIn Spokane, Washington, there is concern about the possibility of a similar tax being imposed statewide, with some arguing that it could be bad for local businesses. Seattle leaders claim that the tax is a good way to discourage people from drinking soda, which can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month\u2014and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon\u2014but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day\u2014and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

House Republicans want to delay the healthcare law, while Democrats oppose any changes. Senate Democrats do not plan to accept any changes to the healthcare law, and President Barack Obama would veto such a bill.

A government shutdown could last several weeks or months, depending on the outcome of the negotiations. The impact of a shutdown on the Washington area would be significant, as federal agencies would close, and services such as trash pickup and libraries would be disrupted. The economy of the region is already weak, and a shutdown could have serious consequences for the region's economy. Federal workers would be furloughed, and local businesses would suffer.\nThe possible shutdown comes at a time when the region's economy is weak, and federal contracting is down $5 billion.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "response": "The Parker Solar Probe, previously known as the Solar Probe Plus, has been renamed after American astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of the solar wind.

The mission will also explore the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The probe will rely on incredible feats of engineering, including a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield, thermal protection system, and solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun. The findings from the mission will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.

According to recent research, persons with coronary heart disease who experienced significant weight fluctuations were significantly more likely to experience heart attacks, strokes, and death than those who experienced little weight change. This association remained even after considering various risk factors, suggesting that weight fluctuation itself may be a critical risk factor. Researchers suggest that their findings should motivate individuals with pre-existing heart disease to maintain a consistent weight to minimize their heart health risk. \n\nIn a related study, investigators found that people with coronary heart disease who experienced substantial changes in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at a much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than those who experienced little weight change. The study of 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, aged between 35 and 75 years, found that for individuals who were overweight or obese at study baseline, there were 117% more heart attacks, 124% more deaths, and 136% more strokes among those who experienced the largest changes in body weight.

Things get pretty vague beyond that: He didn't know the method of transport or when the movement was noticed. But Reuters does pick up some alleged details on those fronts, via an unnamed source quoted by South Korea\u2019s Asia Business Daily. Its source says the ICBM started moving Monday, is only being moved at night, and is headed toward the nation's west coast. Reuters notes there's some likelihood that another test could come on or around Saturday: Sept. 9 is the country's founding day holiday. CNBC notes North Korea conducted a nuke test on Sept. 9, 2016. Two more details that allegedly came from the South's National Intelligence Service briefing: word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the North's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations, and suspicions that the next ICBM test firing might be directed toward the North Pacific but aimed at a lower angle, which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests, which had more of an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the White House tells Reuters it has given \"in-principle approval\" to a request by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to abolish a limit regarding warhead weights, a move that would strengthen the power with which it could attack the North, if necessary. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin on Tuesday gave his take on the situation: North Korea \"will eat grass but will not give up the (nuclear) program if they don't feel safe.\""], "response": "North Korea is believed to be moving an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), according to a South Korean lawmaker. The move comes after the country's sixth test of a nuclear weapon on Sunday, which was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation. North Korea state media claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. South Korean forces have flexed their muscles in response to the nuclear test, and diplomats in New York have condemned the test. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and American President Donald Trump spoke by phone and agreed to lift current restrictions on the payload weight of South Korea's ballistic missiles. However, signs of a rift between the two leaders have become apparent despite the decades-long alliance between Seoul and Washington. China's leader urged for global peace, reiterating calls for North Korea to stop nuclear tests but said dialogue needs to be the answer. North Korea could launch yet another missile as soon as Saturday when the country celebrates its founding day, hot on the heels of its biggest-to-date nuclear test."}

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

The company was raided by federal marshals in Tennessee, with the government preparing to charge Gibson with trafficking in illegally obtained wood. The article provides background on the Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law that was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals, and how it requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The article also quotes Gibson's attorney, who maintains that the company has presented documents to prove its compliance with U.S. and Malagasy law, and that the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India. Other industry experts are quoted, including the Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson, who supports the Lacey Act but acknowledges that it can be burdensome, and Nashville's George Gruhn, who warns of the delays and complications of proving the provenance of old guitars. The article concludes by noting that Gibson has been implicated in wrongdoing but has not been charged with anything, and that the company's business has been injured to millions of dollars.</s>"}

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says. (Mysterious plumes on Mars are stumping scientists.)"], "response": "NASA scientists have revealed new evidence that challenges the conventional belief that Mars was never habitable. According to a recent study, Mars had a massive ancient ocean that covered almost half of its surface. The study, published in the journal Science, was based on infrared measurements of the Martian atmosphere taken over six years using three of the most powerful telescopes in the world. The study found that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past. The study estimates that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters. This finding suggests that Mars was habitable in the distant past and opens up the possibility of life on Mars. Additionally, the study found that the Martian atmosphere thinned over time, leading to the loss of much of its insulation, and the ocean receded and eventually froze, leaving only 13% of the ocean remains locked up in the Martian polar caps.\nMethane on Mars: does it mean the Curiosity rover has found life? NASA's Curiosity rover has detected methane in the Martian atmosphere, sparking intense speculation that the gas might be coming from living organisms. However, there is no evidence to suggest that, as methane is regularly produced on planets through geological processes without any need for life."}

Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters. The brand name itself of \"KitKat\" is not being contested. (Atari accused Nestle of ripping off one of its popular video games in an ad for KitKat.)"], "response": "In the news, Nestle's attempt to trademark the distinctive shape of Kit Kat was unsuccessful.

In 2015, the British courts ruled that Nestle could not trademark the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars, and the case has been mirrored in the Kit Kat dispute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</s>"}

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. \u201cA cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,\u201d says the lead author. \u201cThat suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The study suggests that the mighty dinosaur may have had feathers, and its roar may have been more of a low-pitched hum than a fierce growl.\n\n2. Scientists have discovered that birds vocalize using an open beak, but some dinosaurs may have made sounds using a closed mouth. The study found that at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds and dinosaurs, closed-mouth vocalizations have evolved.\n\n\n3. The study used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups. The researchers identified 52 out of 208 investigated bird species that use closed-mouth vocalization.\n\n4. According to the study, closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, which includes birds and dinosaurs. Only animals with a relatively large body size use closed-mouth vocalization behavior.\n\n\n5. The study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization may have been present in at least some extinct non-avian dinosaurs. This raises the possibility that some dinosaurs may have made low-frequency sounds in a manner similar to birds today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the study challenges the traditional view of T. rex's roar and suggests that some dinosaurs may have had feathers and made sounds using a closed mouth. Closed-mouth vocalization may have evolved in dinosaurs, and this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays. Further research is needed to understand the sounds that extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors produced.</s>"}

This technology has the potential to unlock the secrets of the mind, allowing us to see what's going on in someone's thoughts and dreams. This study is just the beginning, but the possibilities are endless.\nIn another study, researchers from UC Berkeley were able to read brain patterns to recreate YouTube videos. This technology has the potential to allow people who are paralyzed to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements. Additionally, this technology could be used to broadcast imagery, allowing us to see into people's dreams and memories.\nThese findings are a small step towards \"Jedi mind reading,\" but they pave the way for a future where we can understand the dynamic visual experiences of the mind. This technology could also be used in detective work or court cases, but it's important to consider the limitations of the technology and the nature of memories.\nIn conclusion, the future of neuroscience is looking bright, and these discoveries bring us one step closer to unlocking the secrets of the human brain.</s>"}

Warren also questioned Stumpf's compensation, noting that he made $19.3 million in annual compensation in 2015, including a performance bonus of $12.5 million, and that Wells Fargo's share price had risen by about $30, \"which comes out to more than $200 million in gains, all for you personally.\"\nStumpf testified with a conspicuously bandaged right hand, which he attributed to an injury sustained playing with his grandchildren.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which\u2014like the one visible on New Year's Day\u2014will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

The total phase of the eclipse will last 77 minutes, with the moon's lower limb appearing much brighter than the dark upper limb. This event happens once every 150 years and is considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some. The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a free, live, online viewing of the eclipse, and there are also several passes available for the event. The moon will turn blood-red during the eclipse due to the way the atmosphere bends light, creating a reddish hue. The best time to view the eclipse is after moonrise and before sunrise, when the moon is largest and brightest. The supermoon and lunar eclipse can also be viewed without going outside by using the Virtual Telescope Project's livestream or other online resources. To photograph the event, use the daylight white balance on a DSLR camera, and keep in mind that the moon is a moving object. Finally, it is not necessary to wear special glasses to view the eclipse, as it is safe to view with the naked eye.\n\n</s>"}
