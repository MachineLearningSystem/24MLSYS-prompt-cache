The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year.

Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract.

The study also discovered that the increased resistance lasts for 24 hours after exposure and can be inherited.\n\nCigarette smoke has long been associated with various health hazards, including infectious diseases.

Kerry is the most senior US official to go to Pakistan since bin Laden's death, but since issuing the joint pledge, he said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will soon announce her own plans to visit, the AP reports. Kerry's meetings with Pakistani leaders began last night, the Washington Post reports. Many in Washington think Pakistan is harboring Islamist militants, and some members of Congress are calling for the US to sever the billions of dollars in aid it provides to Pakistan. Kerry is in Pakistan to lay out the new stakes following bin Laden's death, and question officials about how bin Laden was able to hide in Pakistan for years. In Kabul, Kerry said there is \"some evidence\" that the Pakistan government has knowledge of insurgent activities, calling it \"very disturbing.\""], "response": "The United States and Pakistan have agreed to work together in future anti-terrorism operations, even though Pakistan was not informed of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. U.S. Senator John Kerry met with Pakistani officials to recalibrate the relationship and address points of contention, including Pakistan's alleged support for terrorist groups. The U.S. has also agreed to return the tail of a damaged stealth helicopter that was destroyed during the bin Laden raid, and both countries will cooperate in operations against high-value targets in Pakistan. The relationship between the two countries has been strained since the bin Laden raid, with Pakistan expressing anger over the violation of its sovereignty. However, both countries recognize the importance of their relationship and are seeking to rebuild trust. In addition, the U.S. has assured Pakistan that it has no designs on Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, and U.S. officials will visit Pakistan soon to discuss implementation of a \"road map\" for improving relations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</s>"}

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes\u2014similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The discovery of Caihong provides important insights into the evolution of feathers and flight in dinosaurs, and sheds new light on the diversity of theropod dinosaurs during the Early Late Jurassic period. The study of Caihong juji is significant because it offers a unique opportunity to explore the early evolution of feathers and their role in the diversification of life on Earth. </s>"}

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month\u2014and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon\u2014but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "response": "Renamed to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, the Parker Solar Probe will attempt to get close to the sun's surface.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

According to recent data, one in seven patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer are under the age of 50. This shift in demographics suggests that screening guidelines may need to be reevaluated to include younger people.\n\n\n\nThe study analyzed cancer registry data from 1998 to 2011 for nearly 258,000 patients with colorectal tumors and found that 37,847 of them, or almost 15 percent, were diagnosed before age 50. Younger patients were more likely to have advanced cancer and more likely to undergo aggressive treatment, including surgery and radiation therapy. Despite being diagnosed at an earlier age, these patients lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese findings suggest that improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults are needed. The study's authors note that one shortcoming of the research is the lack of data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancers, and it's possible that selection bias may have influenced treatment choices and overall survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChan noted that although the incidence of colon cancer is increasing among people under 50, the risk is still low. However, the data at this point do not support expanding screening to younger age groups.

Shares of Tesla are currently down about 1%."], "response": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc., made a surprising announcement on Twitter, stating that he was considering taking the company private at a price of $420 per share, which would value the company at over $70 billion. This proposal has sparked a flurry of activity and questions among investors, regulators, and industry experts.\n\nThe board of directors of Tesla has confirmed that it will consider Musk's proposal, and the company has met several times in the past week to discuss the proposal. According to a statement from several board members, Musk had opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private last week, and the talks addressed how being a private company could better serve Tesla's long-term interests.\nHowever, Musk's decision to disclose the possible de-listing via social media has raised questions about the timing and method of the announcement. Andrew M Calamari, a partner at the law firm Finn Dixon  Herling and former director of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, noted that companies are allowed to make announcements via social media, but typically also make a simultaneous regulatory filing.\n\n\nThe brief statement from the board members left out several key details, including whether the board was satisfied with Musk's method or timing for announcing the approach, and whether the board had discussed the appropriated next steps. The statement did not include Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk, and Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist.\n\n\nThe proposal to take Tesla private has sparked a wild swing in the company's stock price, with shares reaching a peak of $368 after Musk's tweets and fluctuating after the board members issued their statement. The board members explained in a staff memo why Musk wanted to take the company private, stating that being public subjected Tesla to wild swings in its stock price and the quarterly earnings cycle, which can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of the deal also remains ambiguous, with regulators likely to be interested in what evidence exists - such as agreements with investors or banks - for Mr Musk's claim that funding was \"sec"}

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"\u2014an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience\u2014to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy\u2014that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "response": "According to a new paper by Dan Hooper, an astrophysicist at Fermilab and the University of Chicago, humanity may soon face a cosmic competition for energy: harvesting stars. A civilization determined to maximize its energy intake will expand throughout the universe, capturing stars from other galaxies and harnessing their energy before they become inaccessible. This may be possible with satellites and solar power, and could be observed by unusual light signatures in distant galaxies. The inevitability of the expanding universe could lead to intergalactic competition for energy, and humans may soon notice stars being dragged across galaxies.\nIn related news, it's been proposed that ancient extraterrestrial civilizations may have created a swarm of satellites in a spherical shell to harness the power of their star. This idea was first proposed by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker,\" and was later recognized by physicist Freeman Dyson in a scientific paper in 1960. The waste heat from advanced civilizations could be detected as infrared radiation, and practical Dyson spheres would be made from millions of individual solar-collecting satellites.\nKardashev proposed three types of civilizations based on the amount of energy they harness: Type I harnesses all the resources of a planet, Type II harnesses all the radiation of a star, and Type III harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. Humans may reach Type II in a few thousand years and Type III in a few hundred thousand to a million years.\nFinally, Dyson spheres and other mega-structures have appeared frequently in science fiction, including in the 1970 novel \"Ringworld\" by Larry Niven and the 1992 \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\""}

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "response": "In Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, archaeologists have found evidence of early toolmaking and trade networks among early humans. At around 320,000 years ago, hominids used obsidian tools that came from at least 25 to 50 km away. This suggests that early humans had the ability to adapt to changing environments and developed technological innovations to obtain more or different types of food. The new reports fit with genetic evidence that Homo sapiens originated in Africa between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago.\nIn addition, recent discoveries in the Middle Stone Age at Olorgesailie reveal \"the roots of that kind of migration\" that occurred during repeated cycles of droughts and high rainfall. This challenges the previously held belief that modernity arose outside of Africa. Instead, it suggests that components of the \"human revolution\" were found in the African Middle Stone Age around 280,000-50,000 years ago. The team found distinct differences in the forms of stone tools compared to older deposits in the area, indicating technological innovation had taken place.\nFurthermore, excavations at five sites dating from 320,000 years ago found distinct differences in the forms of stone tools compared to older deposits in the area, indicating technological innovation had taken place. Obsidian used for the Middle Stone Age tools came from far away, raising the likelihood of long-distance contacts and trading among hominid populations. The discovery of bright red ochre pigment displaying evidence of grinding and cut marks, which makes this among the oldest known pigments used to color rocks in the archaeological record, marks the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the East African record.\nOverall, the discoveries suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and developed technological innovations to obtain more or different types of food.

Meanwhile, the water department's shut-off campaign has drawn international attention, with the United Nations appealing to have service restored to customers and to prevent more shut-offs. Activists have protested the shut-offs as an affront to human rights, with one arrests taking place on Thursday. The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department has announced plans to use $1 million from its Detroit Residential Water Assistance Program to help low-income customers avoid shut-offs, and Detroit congressman John Conyers has requested \"immediate federal action\" in the form of funding for the problem."}

The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement. Jamaica also hopes to boost its health tourism and medical marijuana industries and make it a major player in the pot product market, the Guardian notes. International exporting, however, remains a no-no.

This development comes after years of debate and efforts to relax laws prohibiting ganja. The country's parliament has passed an act that makes possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana a petty offense resulting in a fine rather than a criminal record. Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises will also be permitted.\nThe new law also establishes a cannabis licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. This move by Jamaican lawmakers aligns with international trends of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. \n\nMoreover, the law makes provision for tourists who are prescribed medical marijuana abroad to apply for permits authorizing them to legally buy small amounts of Jamaican weed.\n\n\nHowever, the government does not plan to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. Jamaica has long been considered the Caribbean's largest supplier of marijuana to the U.S. and regional islands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law also eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records.

Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human. But a New York judge yesterday ruled that the writ may be used by two lab chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, Science magazine reports. NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

The second passage covers a court ruling that granted two chimpanzees at Stony Brook University the right to a writ of habeas corpus, which may lead to their release from captivity.\nHowever, these legal victories are threatened by recent executive actions, including the MCA, which has extended a second-class system of justice beyond Guantanamo Bay. This erosion of habeas corpus undermines the foundation of the legal and constitutional framework of the US. The Nonhuman Rights Project has brought three cases to challenge the detention of chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, and a court ruling has granted them the right to have their day in court. This decision recognizes chimpanzees as legal persons for the first time, and could lead to their release from captivity. However, opponents of personhood for animals caution against reading too much into the ruling, and suggest that the judge may have simply ordered a hearing to gather more information on the legal personhood claim.\nOverall, the news articles highlight the importance of defending the right to habeas corpus and the protection it provides against executive power.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says. (Mysterious plumes on Mars are stumping scientists.)"], "response": "A massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of Mars, making it a promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold, Nasa scientists say. The huge body of water contained standard water molecules, made from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and another form of water made with a heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. However, the Martian atmosphere thinned, and the drop in pressure meant more ocean water wafted into space. The planet lost much of its insulation too. No longer warm enough to keep the water liquid, the ocean receded and eventually froze, leaving only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up the Martian polar caps.\n\nNasa's Curiosity rover has already shown that Mars had standing water for 1.5 billion years, longer than it took for life to emerge on Earth. The Exomars rover will look for chemical signatures of life, perhaps emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil. Last year, the Curiosity rover detected methane in the Martian atmosphere, sparking intense speculation that the gas might be coming from living organisms. However, there is no evidence to suggest it is. Methane is regularly produced on planets through geological processes without any need for life.\n\n\n\nAncient Mars was a warm and wet planet, with an ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface. The Atlantic, by comparison, covers about 17% of Earth's surface. \n\n\n\nThe search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the red planet.

In a review titled \"Will Smith just stole $12 from your pocket,\" he argues Focus is \"ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it.\" Nicky and Jess lack \"impact,\" partly because \"Smith is not a strong leading man,\" he says.

The movie has been described as a \"dapper-con genre\" film that has a relaxed feel and a tone similar to movies made in the past. The casting of the movie was interesting, as there were several actors who were considered for the lead roles, including Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck. The movie's director, John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, have said that they wanted to make a movie that had a \"modest goal and effortless allure\" like a 60-year-old Hitchcock movie. The movie has also been praised for its lead actors, with Will Smith being described as the \"real deal\" and Margot Robbie being compared to a modern Grace Kelly.\nIn the passage three, the character of Will Smith is described as someone who has the ability to persuade anyone of anything, and this talent has been a key part of his career. Smith's career began in rap music, but he gained widespread recognition for his role in the NBC comedy \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\" He has since become known for his ability to charm his way into high society in movies such as \"Six Degrees of Separation\" and \"Men in Black.\"</s>"}

Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. \u201cA cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,\u201d says the lead author. \u201cThat suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture. (Scientists have grown chickens with dinosaur legs.)"], "response": "Several recent studies have shed light on the vocalizations of dinosaurs and their relatives. Researchers analyzed the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups and found that this behavior has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, including birds and crocodiles. The study suggests that closed-mouth vocalization can emerge in diverse archosaur species depending on behavioral or environmental circumstances. The researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of this vocal ability among birds and other reptilian groups and identified 52 out of 208 investigated bird species that use closed-mouth vocalization.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations are typically produced by pushing air into an esophageal pouch, which produces lower-pitched sounds than those produced through an open beak. Birds use this behavior to attract mates or defend their territory, but it is unlikely that this behavior was present in the ancestors of modern archosaurs. The study's findings suggest that closed-mouth vocalization can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays.\n\n\n\nIn addition, a new study has found that many modern bird species make closed-mouth vocalizations, and the largest species are more likely to do so. The study analyzed the x-ray images of birds making cooing sounds with a closed mouth and found that the inflation of an elastic cavity could present a size-dependent challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, and this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, and hence would have co-occurred with open-mouthed vocalizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, researchers are still unsure about how the ancestors of modern archosaurs vocalized, but the occurrence of closed-mouth vocalization across birds and crocodiles indicates that closed-mouth vocalization can emerge in diverse archosaur species depending on behavioral or environmental circumstances."}

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on\u2014except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found. Bayesian techniques have helped people find World War II U-boats, men overboard, and sunken treasure, but there's no evidence that Malaysia is employing them now. \"I suspect that they just guess, like professional baseball managers used to do before Moneyball,\" says a biostatistician."], "response": "Bayesian statistical methods can help refine and focus the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014. These methods allow hunters to update their estimates of the probability of finding their target in any latitude-longitude combination - or even in three dimensions, accounting for depth in the water. In the case of Flight 370, Bayesian statisticians can help estimate the probability of the plane being found in a particular area based on information such as flight path, wind, ocean flow, and which areas have already been searched.\nThe Air France Flight 447 crash in 2009 provides a good example of how Bayesian statistical methods can help solve a mystery. In this case, Metron searchers had to calculate the probability that the beacons would be heard within 1,730 meters (a little over a mile) of every point in the area of the Atlantic they were scanning. They also had to account for the possibility that the beacons had been damaged in the crash. By using Bayesian statistical methods, the scientists were able to bring together all the available information and assess the uncertainties of each piece of data, creating a most likely solution.\nIn Malaysia, Bayesian statistical methods are being used to help find missing jetliners. Colleen Keller, a Metron senior analyst, has been working on the search for Flight 370 using Bayesian statistical methods. Keller and her team from Metron Inc in Virginia have been relied on Bayesian statistics to assess various scenarios, calculate the probability of each being true, and combine them to give the most likely solution.\nThomas Bayes, a British Presbyterian minister, is the founder of Bayesian statistical methods. Bayesian statistical methods allow you to assess various scenarios at once - even contradictory ones. They also allow you to combine views that contradict each other. This flexibility makes Bayesian statistical methods very useful in situations where information is incomplete or uncertain.\nBayesian statistical methods have many applications beyond aviation and aerospace. They are used all over the world, built into software that forecasts events including financial markets and weather.\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistical methods can help solve mysteries such as the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 by refining and focusing the search based on"}

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald.

Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires. She wasn't injured. (This driver followed her GPS into a lake.)"], "response": "On Wednesday evening in Mendon, Vermont, a car became suspended from a telephone guy wire after the driver reacted too quickly to a GPS unit's instructions to turn around.
