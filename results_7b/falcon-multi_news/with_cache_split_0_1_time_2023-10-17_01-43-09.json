The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year.

The company had indicated earlier in the day that it may also have to reduce its dividend, the Wall Street Journal reports. Dudley is set to receive the full bonus he was eligible for, which comes to $4.2 million (including $1.4 million in cash and a portion in deferred BP shares), per an earlier MarketWatch report. This amount was bumped up from the $3 million ($1 million in cash) he received in 2014.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

The not-too-subtle implication here is that for those whose have made poor life decisions and whose are on a path of recklessness, then just go hike a long distance trail and everything will work out. In Cheryl Strayed\u2019s case, it seems to have. She overcame arriving underprepared, with a lack of any real wilderness experience, and a seriously overloaded pack to hike over 1000 miles.\n\nFor those who wish to tackle its challenges, those that arrive unprepared can quickly find themselves in situations on the trail that begin to negatively affect others, as well as the trail environment. Hiking for Salvation\n\nThe Latin phrase solvitur ambulando is occasionally invoked by thru-hikers. It means \u201cit is solved by walking\u201d, and the concept recognizes that many of life\u2019s previously big issues can melt away when we focus simply on hiking every day.\n\nHowever hikers desperate to \u2018find themselves\u2019 often embark on such a challenging journey from a mindset of ineptitude, rather than competence. This mentality of deliberate helplessness often leads to on-trail actions that can serve to endanger themselves and the trail environment, and negatively affect the experience of other hikers with whom they share the trail.\n\nWhile the trail is certainly a place to learn and grow, setting out on a long hike deliberately unprepared, while hoping to find some ultimate redemption is an undertaking for the foolhardy.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes\u2014similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The massive tax increased the price of sugary beverages by more than 64 percent. The primary purpose of the tax was to generate revenue for the city. However, the high price resulted in many people purchasing the product outside the city limits, leading to an estimated reduction in revenue by about 30 percent. The tax proved unpopular with consumers as it was used to justify higher prices.\n\nThe pro-tax arguments emphasized public health and equity. However, public health advocates said that the tax would likely have limited effectiveness, and that it would be worth the cost for personal health improvements. This conflicted with the equity argument as the tax also disproportionately affected people living in lower-income neighborhoods.<|endoftext|>"}

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month\u2014and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon\u2014but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

Because these symptoms may be nonexistent, mild, or infrequent, many people are not aware of their condition until their malignancy becomes advanced and spreads into the lymph nodes. A colonoscopy is the usual screening test, but stool tests are also effective for some people. If you are worried, you can request your primary care physician provide you with one of these simple stool tests, no matter your age.\n\nThere is a rising rate of colorectal cancer diagnosis among younger people. A study of data from patients diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2011 showed that more than 37,847 (about 15 percent) were younger than 50, and they were more likely to be diagnosed with either regional or distant malignancies (cancer that has spread from its original tumor), which are more dangerous than localized tumors.\n\nYoung patients facing a distant metastasis from colorectal cancer were more likely to undergo surgery than older patients. Treatment of rectal cancer was also more likely to be used with younger patients, such as radiation therapy.\n\nDespite the tendency to have more advanced disease when diagnosed, younger patients overall lived longer without a cancer recurrence.\n\nWith regard to localized disease, the five-year survival rate was 95.1 percent in younger patients versus 91.9 percent in older patients, with regard to regional disease, 76 percent versus 70.3 percent, and with regard to distant disease 21.3 percent versus 14.1 percent.\n\nThe researchers believe their work is a wake-up call for the medical community, which should be looking for the signs of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 50.\n\nIf age 50 is maintained as the recommended time to begin screening, this study suggests that nearly 15 percent of all patients may be caught late in the process of disease"}

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved.

Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "response": "The Apple event on September 7, 2016 introduced a number of products, including the iPhone 7, 7 Plus, and AirPods.

Some praised the new audio technologies, while others bemoaned the loss of the beloved headphone jack. In the end, Apple decided to stay the course despite heavy criticism, citing space constraints and technological progress as the main reasons for the decision.

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements. (United had some \"unfortunate dog incidents\" earlier this year.)"], "response": "News:\n1. Up to this week, United Airlines updated its boarding process to rely on fewer boarding lanes, a move that will cut down on congestion and potentially speed up passenger loading.\n\n2. The new boarding process has been in the works for months. In June, United started experimenting with different boarding procedures in a handful of test gates in Chicago and Houston, two of the busiest hubs in the airline's network.\n\n3. Moving forward, the airline will still have five boarding groups but will only use two lanes for boarding. Priority passengers in group 1 and 2 will load through lane 1, while customers in group 3, 4 and 5 will use lane 2. Those not actively boarding will be asked to remain seated until paged.\n\n4. Chase co-branded credit card holders, according to the blog Wandering Aramean, will board in group 2.\n\n5. In addition to the new boarding process, United is also launching push notifications for those who have the airline's mobile app. Those who opt in will be given a push notification when boarding starts, a tool that will be particularly useful if a flight is delayed or if the ground crew decides to load the aircraft early.\n\n6. This week's updates come as the latest milestone in a long history of experimentation that United and other airlines have performed around the oft-complicated and congested boarding process.\n\n7. Several years ago, in an effort to better segment the cabin and speed up loading, United started using five lanes to feed through passengers. And while that method successfully segmented passengers in the boarding zone and prepared them for departure, it also created a fair amount of idle, standing passengers and congestion near the gate.\n\n8. The new strategy launched this week helps alleviate that problem.\n\n9. Indeed, some of United's peers are already using this simplified process. American Airlines currently boards by zone using only two lanes while Delta Air Lines splits the difference and boards with four.\n\n10. One difference between United and its competitors, however, is that as of this week, top tier or \"1K\" elite members will be able to pre-board before the official process starts; with most carriers only VIP passengers are given that access.\n\nSummary: \nThe new boarding process will result in fewer passenger loadings, happier passengers, and an overall better experience while on your flight.<|endoftext|>"}

NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters. The brand name itself of \"KitKat\" is not being contested.

The experiment sought to understand the function of the brain by reconstructing the appearance of movie scenes from brain patterns alone. The researchers also studied the function of the brain's visual cortex and improved on a similar study in which they reconstructed the appearance of static images. By combining neural activity recordings and computer models they created a video of a YouTube video. This experiment demonstrates how we may be able to observe others' imaginations in the future. The study's results may be useful in understanding mental processing and the basis of memory formation. However, the extent to which the experiment will be applied to future applications, such as dreaming, remains to be seen.\n\nPotential applications:\nThe team's model has potential to be applied to real-life scenarios to recreate views. This technology is already being applied in medicine. For example, doctors may be able to project a patient's perspective on the process of healing, which could allow medical professionals to make more informed decisions.\n\nHowever, this approach is not yet accurate enough to replace the imagination process or draw definitive conclusions. The ability to gather visual data without a physical viewer is still in development. But, by recording and analyzing the patterns of brain activity, the team hopes to learn more about the neural activities of the visual cortex. This study may be able to shed light on mental activity, including activities like dreaming and other forms of creative thinking.\n\nEthical implications:\nThis study raises ethical concerns about privacy and consent. Although the technology is still limited, how it may impact privacy and subject consent is an area of study. It is possible that the recorded data may be sold or used for research without consent or appropriate measures are taken to safeguard the information. For example, researchers would need to make sure participants understand the nature of the experiment, and how their data is used.\n\n---\nNote: I did not get into the impact of the findings on society, law, or science.

Of course our lawmakers \"might have to figure out how to put those plastic coffee pods in the machines themselves, but these people are not fools,\" he writes. \"They will order out. If they can figure out how to work the telephones.\" In fact, House Republicans are positively excited about the sequester, writes Dana Milbank in the Washington Post, noting their agenda yesterday consisted only of renaming a California NASA research center. They're \"pursuing a considered strategy of deliberate idleness,\" after finally realizing that doing nothing means they get \"a 2.5% cut in all federal spending without coughing up a single dollar in tax increases. They have learned to stop worrying and love the sequester.\" Click for Milbank's full piece; Simon's humorous take is here."], "response": "1) Sequestration has been designated as the latest state of affairs in the US federal budget negotiations. Sequestration entails several spending reductions in priority services, including federal healthcare and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education programs.\n\n2) Sequestration poses a threat to federal jobs and contracts, and would likely drive up costs of Medicare and social benefits. In an effort to avoid sequestration, Democratic lawmakers have proposed compromise on spending cutbacks as well as tax hikes,\n\n3) Republican legislators have opposed federal spending cuts on their core priorities and raised concerns with the involvement of Democrats in Washington government decision making. The House of Representatives adjourned for recess this week and Republican leadership expressed opposition to President Obama\u2019s request to increase taxes in order to replace sequestration reductions. However, when in reality the measures will likely not impact them directly.\n\n4) Democrats are scheduled to take a break in March, further complicating budget negotiations. President Obama will address the nation next week to reiterate his position and urge Congress to avoid sequestration.\n\n5) The Head Start preschool program, which serves more than 1.5 million low-income children, is expected to see steep spending cuts, as are STEM education programs in K-12 schools, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s weather satellites.\n\n6) The banking industry and healthcare companies are among the entities expected to take hits as federal funds are reduced. In Congress, the battle over new federal spending cuts and sequestration is expected to continue and settle on a more agreeable budget resolution.\n\n7) Conclusion: In summary, federal spending reduction measures and sequester continue to threaten key services for Americans and may be difficult for Congress to resolve. Democrats have proposed tax increases to replace spending cuts, Republicans remain opposed to raising taxes and both sides appear ready to go to the brink for what they want on spending and taxes.<|endoftext|>"}

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "response": "- In Egypt, former president Hosni Mubarak faced corruption allegations in his final phase of election today. Although the third phase of parliamentary elections were interrupted by the trial, Islamists consolidated their gains from the first two.\n\n- Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters and the corruption charges of his sons. He faces the death penalty if convicted, despite being surrounded by generals beholden to him for his rise in the military. His prosecution is part of the growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they will not cede power before presidential elections are held.\n\n- Mubarak's two sons and an associate are held in prison. Mubarak's health has deteriorated, and he remains in hospital, possibly under house arrest. Judges in the corruption case denied a defense request for him to be moved, saying the judicial committee that's hearing the case will rule on the decision.<|endoftext|>"}
