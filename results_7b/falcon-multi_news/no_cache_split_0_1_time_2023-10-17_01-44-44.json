But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke.

Originating as a strain of staph infection, MRSA becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. A disastrous diagnosis due to its innate difficulty to treat, it has become even more threatening with the addition of smoking. Through their finding, Crotty Alexander and her team hope to add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.<|endoftext|>"}

The UN worries that major food shortages could be imminent, and \"mayhem in these towns and cities is increasing,\" says a rep. Neighboring countries have established an embargo against the rebels who ousted the president; they've closed off their borders and frozen the country's regional bank account.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge.

Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The news summary contains information about a possible parole hearing for Mark Chapman, a former prisoner who committed the 1980 murder of John Lennon.\n\n2. Gloria Hiroko Chapman, Chapman's wife, has waited for almost 40 years since the assassination of John Lennon, despite being still allowed to have sex with him.\n\n3. Since then, the man has been in prison and continued to write to Chapman on a weekly basis, referring to himself as a murderer but also telling his wife about his efforts at rehabilitation.\n\n4. As of 2022, the New York State parole board is considering how long Chapman had been planning to kill John Lennon before the incident took place.\n\n5. Chapman's freedom is largely dependent on the parole board's decision. His case has been seen as a major test case for the US legal system.\n\n6. Gloria claims that Mark has changed since the early days of their marriage, but that she is still willing to have him in her life when he is released, if he is approved by the parole board.\n\n7. It is notable that as a result of Chapman's time behind bars, the board now takes a wider range of factors into account when deciding parole, including the prisoner's behaviour behind bars.\n\n8. In addition, Gloria has relied on her faith in Jesus Christ to help her through difficult times.\n\n9.

Secret Service is involved in political activities: Secret Service agents may be compromised by political involvement, such as the election campaign of former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. In addition, the revelation about Chaney's flirtation with Palin adds to speculation about the potential involvement of Secret Service agents in secret activities with other high profile persons.\n\n2.

Moreover, Senate Judiciary Committee member Jeff Sessions declared a brief remark for the committee \"You should take him (referring to David Chaney) and fire him.\" Secret Service employees must follow their orders and procedures and should stay politically neutral.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "response": "- Two news passages have been presented: the description of the Parker Solar Probe mission, and a description of the life and legacy of Eugene Parker, the famous solar astrophysicist whose work inspired the mission.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is set to enter the solar system and study the sun's atmosphere, or corona, which is an extremely hot and dynamic region that extends hundreds of thousands of miles above the solar surface.

That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks\u2026perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail\u2026leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

Two years prior to this event, the city was still reeling from Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm that was known as \"The Storm of the Century.\" More than 1000 people lost their lives, 700,000 people were left homeless, the city suffered an estimated $108 billion in damages. Ricks knew that unlike Katrina, this hurricane was unique and posed a different set of challenges. The city's levees were much improved, but the storm would be much stronger than Katrina with Category 4 winds. The hurricane would make landfall early in the morning of August 29th. Ricks began to put together a graphic forecast report that was also seen by Weather Underground Meteorologist Bob Henson. The report included bold statements such as: \"This storm will likely be the most catastrophic Atlantic hurricane to ever hit land in the United States\" and \"It may be a catastrophe of historic proportions.\" The report also included a special message from Ricks: \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks. Possibly longer.\" Ricks knew that what was about to happen to the city was much more serious and life-threatening than anything he had ever seen. New Orleans survived and was helped by hundreds of thousands of volunteers, journalists, and government officials from around the nation. There were many incredible stories of heroism and bravery, including rescues of people from their rooftops.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Based on real events, the film reunites Bigelow with screenwriter Mark Boal, both of the Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker. It's got a strong 89% \"fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: \"Bigelow drills down into one of American history's most egregious cases of abuse of police power, bringing it to life with visceral detail and slowed-down meticulousness\" in what \"feels like her timeliest movie yet,\" writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. It's \"daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing.\" And \"in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental.\" \"It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,\" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit \"a well-made and evocative film\" jam-packed with \"stomach-churning horror.\" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But \"maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point.\" Chris Klimek says Detroit is \"maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,\" citing \"lightly fictionalized\" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up \"for maximum outrage.\" This is \"messy work, even when it\u2019s done in good faith,\" he writes at NPR.

Peter Howell's main gripe is that the film \"tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people.\" But Detroit still makes for \"urgent viewing,\" he writes at the Toronto Star. Why? \"The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on,\" when \"a person's skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police.\""], "response": "Title | Detroit\nPremiere | August 11, 2017\nDirector | Kathryn Bigelow\nWriter | Mark Boal\nPrimary Cast | Will Poulter, Anthony Mackie, John Boyega, Algee Smith\n\nPlot Summary | Set in 1967, the police force in the city of Detroit is demoralized by recent riots sparked by deep-seated racial tensions and conflict between the police and black citizens.\nA band of black youths spends an evening at an open-air club that has violated city ordinances. They are greeted by a large contingent of heavily armed police, who attempt to search the premises for illegal drugs and alcohol, but are rebuffed and eventually break down the door of the club. The police search is a pretense for a set-up of a demonstration against the police by a radical group of activists.\nThe movie follows the events that ensue when the Detroit police, who have been outmaneuvered and left no alternative to beating an aggressive crowd, are forced to take action.\nAnalysis | This is the story of a summer in the 1960s when the racial tensions of Detroit erupted into a firestorm of protest and violence that left 43 people dead and nearly 1000 arrested. The police force in the city is demoralized by the violence and conflict between the police and black citizens, but the raw footage of these events is compelling, even more so because of its lack of context.\nThe script by Mark Boal uses real events and actual characters, including a young police officer who witnesses the violence of the incident, but takes the time to defend his position and actions. The viewer can never be sure if he's on the right side of history or not, but the film can never hide the anger of its characters and their leaders.\nReview | \"Detroit\" is a fast-moving film, with plenty of action scenes that keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat. The performances are strong, especially from John Boyega and Anthony Mackie, and the cinematography is excellent, with intense lighting and atmosphere throughout the film.\nOne criticism is that the film is a bit too long and could have been tightened up a bit, but there is plenty of good filmmaking here.<|endoftext|>"}

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"\u2014an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience\u2014to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home.

It's also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization entirely alone in the vastness of space.\n\n5. The existence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, Hooper wrote in the new paper.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "response": "News:\nPassage 1:\nThe title of the news was \"Researchers Explain Prolonged Climate Change\".\nThese scientists observed the East African climate more than thirty thousand years ago, and after recovering and analyzing artifacts at Olorgesailie, they created a theory of how the climate impacted the Homo sapiens. It was noted in their report that the length of the climate cycle may have directly influenced human technological developments.\n\nPassage 2:\nThis second passage went into more detail about Stone Age technologies. Before 400,000 years ago, there were much clearer indications of extreme Stone Age technologies, such as those found at the Cave of Hearths, which may have been used by archaic people before large stone tools were developed. However, Acheuelean artifacts found much later at the 160,000-year-old site of Herto indicate that such tools were still being made at that time. They concluded that at some point, humans became more adept at obtaining usable materials from long distances, such as obsidian from volcanoes hundreds of kilometers away, without relying on immediate nearby sources.\n\nAlthough the term \"modern humans\" is not generally used to describe some of the fossils, it is used here since they were still the first humans to reach a state that may have called them \"modern\" in evolutionary terms. In summary, researchers believe that the climate shifts 320,000 years ago influenced human technological developments across East Africa, and the finding of obsidian from such great distances demonstrates that humans had the ability to trade across greater geographical areas.<|endoftext|>"}

NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

Israel had offered to hold its offensive to accommodate a visit from Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, provided Hamas held its fire as well. But Hamas said it would keep firing, and one Israeli defense minister complained that 50 rockets had flown in from Gaza during Kandil's visit, CNN reports. A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. \u201cA cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,\u201d says the lead author. \u201cThat suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture. (Scientists have grown chickens with dinosaur legs.)"], "response": "The T. rex\u2019s roar has struck fear into audiences from the days of King Kong to Jurassic World, but new research found that dinosaurs probably didn\u2019t sound anything like that. The tyrannosaurus rex had a massive body with enough mass to produce low, throaty noises that sound much like what a flock of birds calls out after mating. The dinosaurs\u2019 necks didn\u2019t quite fit closed-mouth sounds since the esophageal pouches in birds that create low roars are much smaller than that in reptiles and crocs.\nThe researchers formed this concept by analyzing all reptiles and crocodilians that can go into a closed-mouth vocalization and organizing the animals\u2019 body sizes. The creation of a very small pouch of air was first possible in arsosaurous animals and originated somewhere in the thousands of years since these animals went extinct. Through the years a large patch of skin was transformed into the pouch, and the ability to sound like a bird came with this change. Some of the potential sound similarities are difficult to see, as younger research during certain events still is unknown. Because a tyrannosaurus has more mass than birds, a roar would have had to grow as it did, and the head probably wouldn\u2019t have made the same noise a bird makes. There\u2019s still some debate going on, but the research suggests the sound would still be higher than the rest of the birds. In a larger modern day version of King Kong, this would\u2019ve been possible even through the new film that he seemed to be based on, though it would\u2019ve made the movie longer if the attention to detail was kept while making it. It might have made the giants seem silly with their voices, though.<|endoftext|>"}

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on\u2014except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

Obesity rates are high in the USA, and it has actually been decreasing in some other developed countries but not in the USA. Obesity rates are particularly high in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America and the Pacific, and the Caribbean. Many of the areas with the highest obesity rates in the USA is made up of people from minority communities and individuals on a lower income. Recent studies have pointed to decreasing populations of certain bacteria in people's guts when studying why the obesity rates are rising, but the causes of why people are becoming obese is complex and is not simply because of decreased activity levels and obesity in their diets, as are often thought to be. Obesity is also occurring in children, with 50% of the obese population being obese adults and an additional 35% of the obese population made up of overweight or obese children.
