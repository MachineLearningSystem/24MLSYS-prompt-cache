When discussing the system's ability to take the person to the door, B mentioned that the system would need to be able to produce better answers and take the person where they want to go, rather than always taking them to the geometric center of a building. This suggests that B thought the system should be more intuitive and user-friendly. Additionally, when discussing the sample data, B mentioned that there may be more data beyond what they had, and that they would need to look at it to see if there were any features that could be extracted. This implies that B was open to exploring the data further to see if it could provide any useful insights.</s>"}
