And Samsung isn't alone: the Verge reports that XBoxes already use voice recognition while being connected to the Internet. \"Samsung's privacy policy is not unique; its rhetoric just happens to be similar to that of a well-known sci-fi novel,\" the Verge says."], "response": "Samsung's new Smart TV privacy policy has drawn attention for its provision to record everything users say and transmit the data to third parties. The policy states that voice recognition software may also transmit data to third parties for evaluation and improvement purposes. The TV has a microphone and can be turned off, but users may disconnect the TV from Wi-Fi to keep their data private. Samsung's statement acknowledged that data is encrypted for safety, but some have compared the policy to George Orwell's dystopian fiction, 1984.  \n\nAdditionally, Samsung's Smart TV service offers personalized content based on user preferences and viewing history. Users can control the TV with voice commands, and the camera can recognize gestures. Facial recognition technology is also used for authentication. However, some users have expressed concerns about the policy's similarity to 1984 and the potential for Samsung to collect too much data.  \n\nMicrosoft has announced that its new Xbox One console will always be listening, even when turned off, to quickly respond to users' commands. The new Kinect will be shipped with every Xbox One and can read users' heartbeats while exercising and recognize individual voices. However, this has raised privacy concerns, as the system may be compromised remotely by malicious actors and always listening could pose greater privacy implications.  \n\nLastly, Samsung's SmartTV service collects information about video content viewed on SmartTV, and users can disable personalized recommendations if they do not wish to receive them. Voice recognition data collection can be disabled at any time, but this may prevent users from using certain features.  \n\nOverall, these news passages highlight the importance of privacy policies and user data collection in the technology industry, specifically in smart TVs and gaming consoles. Companies like Samsung and Microsoft must consider the potential risks of collecting too much data and ensure that they protect user privacy. Users must also be aware of these policies and make informed decisions about their use of these technologies.</s>"}

Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing.

The number of reports from doctors around the country suggests that the actual number of cases may be higher, and some doctors are concerned that the situation may be repeating the 2014 outbreak.

However, no similar widespread outbreak of EV-D68 has been reported this year. The CDC has confirmed that most patients had a fever or respiratory illness before developing paralysis, and that cranial nerve motor dysfunction and altered mental status have also been reported in some cases.

The condition is also known as polio-like illness. The CDC is investigating the cause of the condition, and it is not yet clear if it is linked to EV-D68 or another virus. In the meantime, the CDC is encouraging parents to ensure their children are up to date on all recommended vaccinations to prevent severe diseases, including poliomyelitis.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "response": "JK Rowling founded Lumos to end the harmful and unnecessary practice of institutionalizing children worldwide.

Lumos aims to eradicate institutionalization by 2050, providing inclusive education and health, supporting vulnerable families, and promoting fostering, adoption, or other family-based care alternatives.\n\nLumos has achieved success in several countries, reducing institutionalization by 70% in Moldova and 16% in the Czech Republic. Bulgaria has seen a 54% reduction in institutionalization and a 34% drop in new admissions.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The death of Mohawk, a 13-year-old male lion in Kenya, sparked an outcry among Kenyans, with some asking why rangers did not tranquilize him instead of killing him. The Kenya Wildlife Service said the lion escaped from the Nairobi National Park and was put down as a last resort to protect public safety. The park has had several lion escapes in recent weeks, and officials are unsure why there is a surge in escapes, but conservationists cite habitat loss as the central reason. In South Africa, Sylvester is the second time a lion has escaped from the Karoo National Park in the past year, and wildlife officials are considering various options, including returning the lion to the park and improving its fencing, moving the lion to another park, donating the lion to a conservation group, or killing it if it causes \"massive\" damage or is a direct threat to humans.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times.

The study found that the largest weight fluctuations were linked to a 124% increase in deaths. Past studies have also linked yo-yo dieting to increased risk of death from heart disease. This new research raises concerns about weight fluctuation in people with CHD and suggests that efforts should be made to help Americans keep weight off rather than having it go up and down.\n\nAdditionally, a new study has found that changes in gut microbes may trigger yo-yo dieting. The study found that people who experienced large weight fluctuations had higher levels of certain bacteria in their guts that have been linked to weight gain and weight loss.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed. (Ninety rocks in Australia could rank up there with Stonehenge.)"], "response": "Archaeologists have made a groundbreaking discovery in southern Australia, uncovering a 49,000-year-old human settlement at a site known as Warratyi rock-shelter. The find challenges previous assumptions about the arrival of humans in Australia and provides evidence of local innovation and ingenuity. The site contains artifacts such as burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments. The discovery has implications for our understanding of Indigenous Australians' history and the development of their civilization.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team led by Giles Hamm, an archaeologist from La Trobe University in Melbourne. The team used excavation methods and advanced dating techniques to determine the age of the site. The findings suggest that humans lived alongside megafauna in the arid interior of Australia 10,000 years earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery is significant not only for its age but also for the evidence it provides of the ingenuity of Indigenous Australians. The artifacts found at the site suggest that these early humans developed local technologies and had a sophisticated understanding of the land and its resources. The discovery also challenges the Eurocentric view of the development of material culture in Australia.\n\nThe study has been published in Nature, and the findings are expected to shed new light on the history of human settlement in Australia. The discovery of the Warratyi rock-shelter and the artifacts found within it provide a unique glimpse into the lives of early humans in Australia and challenge our previous understanding of their history and development.</s>"}

Ahead of the Olympics, skiers from both countries will also train together in North Korea, per CNN. The thawing of relations between the North and South has drawn praise from some. But others, like Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, fear Kim Jong Un only hopes to ease international pressure while continuing to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal. \"It is not the time to ease pressure, or to reward North Korea,\" Kono said Tuesday in Vancouver, Canada, where 20 countries met and agreed to consider tougher sanctions on the North, per Reuters. Warning countries not to be fooled by its \"charm offensive,\" Kono added, \"The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working.\" China avoided the meeting, saying it showed a \"Cold War mentality.\""], "response": "In recent news, North and South Korea have agreed to march together under one flag at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony, signaling a thaw in relations between the two countries. This comes as they have also agreed to field a combined women's ice hockey team and share a training facility for skiers. The move is a significant breakthrough following years of strained relations, and could potentially pave the way for further cooperation in the future. However, tensions remain high, with North Korea still maintaining its nuclear weapons program and Japan urging caution over the North's \"charm offensive\". Despite this, a joint US-South Korean military drill has been suspended for the duration of the Olympics as a show of good faith.\n\nAdditionally, the two nations have agreed to form a joint North and South Korean women's ice hockey team for the Games, and North Korea will send a delegation of more than 400 people, including 230 cheerleaders, 140 artists, and 30 taekwondo players for a demonstration. The joint training for skiers will take place at North Korea's Masik Pass resort and Mount Kumgang, and a cultural event will be held at the Mount Kumgang resort.\n\nThe decision to form a joint ice hockey team has been met with mixed reactions, with some athletes expressing concerns about competing with their neighbors. However, the South Korean President Moon Jae-in has expressed support for the decision, saying it could contribute to peace on the Korean Peninsula and improving inter-Korean relations.\n\nOverall, the recent developments represent a significant step towards improved relations between North and South Korea, and could potentially pave the way for further cooperation in the future. However, tensions remain high, and it remains to be seen how long this thaw in relations will last.</s>"}

Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan.

Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "response": "Apple's recent event unveiled new products such as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus without a standard 3.5mm aux cable input (headphone jack).

This decision has sparked criticism from some for eliminating a widely used and successful audio standard. Apple's move towards a proprietary system has also been met with ridicule, with some comparing it to San Francisco's treatment of the middle class.

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements. (United had some \"unfortunate dog incidents\" earlier this year.)"], "response": "United Airlines has introduced a new boarding system to ease congestion and improve the passenger experience. The new system has two lanes instead of five, with pre-boarding for elite members and group 1 boarding. Group 2 will board once group 1 has cleared, and groups 3-5 will board through lane 2. The change is expected to drive significant traffic growth, provide better customer service, and stimulate economic development. \n\nSeparately, United Airlines, Copa Airlines, and Avianca have announced a joint business agreement that will offer customers more routes, competitive fares, and improved travel experiences. The carriers plan to coordinate flight schedules and improve airport facilities, providing better connectivity to their customers. \n\nUnited Airlines has also updated its boarding process, reducing the number of lanes from five to two, and introducing a color-coded system for group boarding. The changes aim to streamline the boarding process, reduce congestion, and improve the overall passenger experience. \n\nFinally, the airline has implemented a new system for boarding, which prioritizes elite members and group 1 boarding, and has eliminated the need for customers to stand in line to hold their spot. The new system aims to address the struggle airlines have had in creating a boarding process that doesn't stress out customers.  \n\nIn summary, United Airlines has implemented new boarding processes and a joint business agreement to improve the passenger experience, drive traffic growth, and stimulate economic development.</s>"}

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says. (Mysterious plumes on Mars are stumping scientists.)"], "response": "Scientists have made significant discoveries about Mars' past using infrared telescopes. They found that the planet had a massive ancient ocean covering nearly half of its surface, suggesting that it was once a more promising place for life. The ocean was estimated to be at least 137 meters deep and contained a high concentration of deuterium, indicating that Mars lost a vast amount of water in the past. This finding supports the idea that Mars was once habitable and possibly inhabited. Additionally, the discovery of methane on Mars has sparked speculation about the possibility of life. The search for life on Mars will continue in 2018 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover mission.\n\nIn another study, astronomers used sunlight reflecting off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere to determine the chemical composition of the Martian atmosphere's vapor. They found that the hydrogen in water on Mars has a higher proportion of deuterium than on Earth, indicating that the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking into outer space. This finding supports the idea that Mars once had a large ocean covered by a thick atmosphere. The scientists estimated that the ocean would have been at least 137 meters deep and would have covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface.\n\nThe discoveries suggest that Mars was once far wetter and warmer than it is today, and the evidence continues to mount that Mars was once habitable and possibly inhabited.

The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.
