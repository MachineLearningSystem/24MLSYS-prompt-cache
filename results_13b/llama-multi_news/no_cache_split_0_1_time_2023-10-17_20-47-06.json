The Los Angeles encampment is one of the largest on the West Coast and has been tolerated for weeks by officials.\n\nMayor Antonio Villaraigosa had given protesters until just after midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal. However, about two hours after the eviction deadline had passed, police commanders said the Occupy LA encampment could stay until at least daybreak. Police Commander Andrew Smith thought it was \"highly unlikely\" that the camp would be forced to shut down on November 28.\n\nThe news passages also mention that the Occupy movement has been relatively accommodating in Los Angeles compared to other cities, with the mayor providing ponchos to campers when it rained. However, after the collapse of negotiations aimed at persuading protesters to relocate voluntarily, the mayor said the encampment would have to go. The mayor complimented the protesters on their peaceful efforts but stated that it was time for Occupy LA to move from focusing on holding a particular patch of park land to spreading their message of economic justice and restoration of balance to American society.\n\nOverall, the news passages indicate that the Occupy movement is ongoing and that protesters are determined to continue their efforts despite eviction deadlines and police actions.</s>"}

The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent. While the judge Friday vacated McCullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the Chicago Tribune reports.

The policy allows Samsung to collect and share user data for the purposes of improving its services and evaluating performance. The TVs also include a camera that can be covered and disabled, but disabling it may prevent users from accessing certain advanced features.\n\nIn addition, Samsung's SmartTV service provides customized content recommendations based on users' viewing habits and device information. The service collects information about users' interactions with the TV, including search queries, button clicks, and network, channel, and program information. Users can opt out of personalized recommendations, but this may limit the relevance of the content displayed on the TV.\n\nMicrosoft's new Xbox One console will always be listening, even when turned off, to respond quickly to users' voice commands. The new Kinect sensor can recognize users' hearts beats and individual voices, and can even read audio that's personalized to specific individuals. This feature has raised privacy concerns, as the system is always-on and connected to the internet, which could pose greater risks if the system is compromised remotely by a malicious actor.\n\nOverall, both Samsung and Microsoft's new products have raised concerns about data privacy and collection, and it is important for companies to be responsible stewards of their customers' data.\n\n</s>"}

Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing. About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling. The CDC reports 121 cases of AFM were confirmed in 2014, but that was followed by just 21 cases in 2015, reports Fox News. From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully.

The exact cause of AFM is not yet known, but there is evidence to suggest that it may be linked to the enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) outbreak.\n\nThe CDC has issued a health advisory and is working with state and local health departments to investigate the outbreak. So far, reports have been received from 17 states, with the majority of cases occurring in the Midwest and West Coast. The CDC is urging healthcare providers to be vigilant in identifying and reporting suspected cases of AFM, and encouraging parents to be aware of the symptoms and seek medical attention if they suspect their child may have the condition.\n\nA 3-year-old boy in Virginia, McKenzie Anderson, is one of the many children affected by the disease. He was previously healthy but suddenly developed a fever and weakness in his left arm and leg. His condition rapidly deteriorated, and he was left with barely any control over his muscles.\n\nThe CDC is also tracking an increase in reports of AFM this year, with a sharp rise in cases compared to the same period last year. The exact cause of the increase is not yet clear, but it is believed to be related to the EV-D68 outbreak.\n\nAs the number of cases continues to rise, doctors and health officials are urging parents to be aware of the symptoms of AFM and to seek medical attention if they suspect their child may have the condition. Treatment options are limited, and most patients recover only partially, but early diagnosis and treatment may improve outcomes.\n\nOverall, the outbreak of AFM is a concerning development, and health officials are working to identify the cause and prevent further cases.</s>"}

Rowling wants to change that, not by improving these orphanages with \"pretty murals\" or teddy bears, but by eliminating them altogether, she writes in the Guardian. The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "response": "JK Rowling has committed to becoming president of Lumos for life and dreams of a future where taking a child away from its family and locking it away seems like a cruel, fictional world.

The organization is working to eradicate the practice of keeping children in institutions by 2050, and has already seen success in several countries with a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions in Moldova and a 75% fall in admissions in the Czech Republic. The solution is no institutions and investment in inclusive education and health, support for vulnerable families, and fostering, adoption, or other family-based care alternatives for children who cannot be with their parents. International donors play a vital role in this regard, and Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050.\n\nThe article highlights the shocking truth that most children in institutions have parents who could care for them and are institutionalized because of poverty, disability, and discrimination. The practice of institutionalization causes children measurable and sometimes irreparable harm, including stunting, developmental delays, and psychological trauma. Children in institutions often lack the love and attention of a dedicated carer, which can cause long-lasting damage, and are more likely to be abused or trafficked.\n\nLumos has seen a critical mass of expertise and evidence on which to build, and millions of people around the world want to see an end to the harmful and unnecessary practice of institutionalization. The #Letstalklumos campaign aims to keep the issue alive and create awareness to change the future for these children.</s>"}

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")"], "response": "The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) is experiencing an influx of hikers due to the book \"Wild\" by Cheryl Strayed and the movie adaptation starring Reese Witherspoon. This has led to an increase in requests for permits and a potential overcrowding problem. The PCTA has implemented a permit quota system to spread out the hikers and mitigate wear on the trail. However, there is concern about the environmental impact and financial costs of more hikers. Some long-time hikers miss the quieter days, and there is a desire to balance accessibility with preservation of the trail.\n\nAdditionally, there is a campaign called #responsiblywild to promote safety and \"leave no trace\" practices among hikers. The PCTA is also launching a new website to provide information on trail conditions, crowding, and other important updates for hikers.\n\nIn conclusion, the PCT is experiencing a surge in popularity due to media attention, which has led to concerns about overcrowding and environmental impact. The PCTA is taking steps to address these issues and promote responsible hiking practices.</s>"}

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones?

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month\u2014and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon\u2014but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business.

The wily Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken the lead role in pushing a hardball Democratic legislative strategy that can be summed up as making the Republicans cave. The government shutdown would affect every federal agency, including the possible closure of childcare centers, delays in processing passport applications, and halts in new patient enrollments in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "response": "NASA has announced that its new spacecraft, the Parker Solar Probe, will be launched in the summer of 2018 to study the sun.

The mission is named after Dr. Eugene Parker, a solar astrophysicist who predicted the existence of the solar wind. The spacecraft will be launched in a 20-day window that opens on July 31, 2018, and will make a Venus flyby before reaching the sun. The probe will fly within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun before.

The policy aims to provide flexibility and confidence to balance family needs without worrying about work or finances. Parents can return part-time, full-time, or go back out as needed, and Netflix will continue to pay them normally. The policy is an extension of the company's \"freedom and responsibility\" culture, which values employee context, freedom, and responsibility.

This forecast, which included phrases like \"Godspeed to all those in the path of this storm,\" was considered the most dire and effective weather forecast ever issued by the National Weather Service. Ricks' document predicted an unprecedented storm with incredible strength, roof and wall failure, and unimaginable human suffering, all of which came true. \n\nIn an interview with Brian Williams, Ricks discussed how he had to validate each point in the statement and how he couldn't find it in himself to take any part out because it all seemed valid for the situation. He also expressed that he would much rather have been wrong in this one and that the response did break his heart because they always prepare for the big one, but they just didn't think it was going to come this soon. \n\nThe second news story highlights the hero status of meteorologist Gary Szatkowski, who issued a personal plea during Hurricane Sandy's landfall in 2012, which included gut-wrenching statements like \"if you are still reluctant (to evacuate), think about your loved ones.\" This plea earned him hero status.\n\nThese two news stories demonstrate the bravery and determination of meteorologists like Robert Ricks and Gary Szatkowski, who have been occasionally used and officially encouraged by the National Weather Service to increase the effectiveness of government bulletins during true weather emergencies.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

However, these findings raise questions about the current guidelines for screening, which begin at age 50. The study suggests that a wake-up call may be needed for the medical community to recognize the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients. The reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unknown, and further research is required to determine if screening guidelines should be altered. Doctors should be aware of the warning signs of colon cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or blockages, and patients with a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors should begin screening earlier than age 50. Additionally, the study suggests that the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.  \n\nPlease let me know if you need any more help!</s>"}

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Based on real events, the film reunites Bigelow with screenwriter Mark Boal, both of the Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker. It's got a strong 89% \"fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: \"Bigelow drills down into one of American history's most egregious cases of abuse of police power, bringing it to life with visceral detail and slowed-down meticulousness\" in what \"feels like her timeliest movie yet,\" writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. It's \"daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing.\" And \"in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental.\" \"It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,\" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit \"a well-made and evocative film\" jam-packed with \"stomach-churning horror.\" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective.

Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point.\" Chris Klimek says Detroit is \"maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,\" citing \"lightly fictionalized\" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up \"for maximum outrage.\" This is \"messy work, even when it\u2019s done in good faith,\" he writes at NPR. He applauds John Boyega, previously of The Force Awakens. Radiating a \"Denzel-like calm,\" he shows \"he's a bonafide movie star,\" Klimek writes. Peter Howell's main gripe is that the film \"tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people.\" But Detroit still makes for \"urgent viewing,\" he writes at the Toronto Star.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"\u2014an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience\u2014to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home.

So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

A new paper posted on the preprint journal arXiv.org has revived Kardashev's model and added a new, apocalyptic twist, proposing that advanced alien civilizations may be harvesting the energy of stars to prevent the expansion of the universe from leaving them alone. \n\nFinally, a science fiction novel from 1937 describes spherical, energy-trapping alien structures, and physicist Freeman Dyson proposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "response": "Recent archaeological discoveries in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin have revealed new insights into the evolution of human behavior and technology. The findings, which date back to around 320,000 years ago, suggest that early Homo sapiens or their close relatives in Africa were capable of adapting to changing environments and developing innovative technologies in response to climate fluctuations. The discoveries include evidence of obsidian tools made from distant sources, red pigment, and standardized stone tools that indicate a greater level of social networking and long-distance trade. These findings challenge the previous view that modern human behaviors emerged only 40,000-50,000 years ago and suggest that the roots of modernity may be much older.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of climate change in driving technological innovation and the emergence of modern human behaviors. The use of obsidian and other exotic materials from distant sources indicates that early humans had developed long-distance trade networks, which suggests a greater level of social organization and complexity. Additionally, the presence of pigment and the standardization of tools indicate a level of creativity and information sharing among early humans.\n\nOverall, these discoveries provide a more nuanced understanding of human evolution and the emergence of modern human behaviors, challenging the traditional view that modernity emerged suddenly 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that early humans were capable of adapting to changing environments and developing innovative technologies over a longer period of time.</s>"}

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says. (Mysterious plumes on Mars are stumping scientists.)"], "response": "Nasa scientists have discovered that Mars was once a more promising place for life to exist, with evidence of a massive ancient ocean that covered nearly half of the planet's surface. The ocean is believed to have been at least a mile deep and would have been able to support life for a significant period of time. The discovery was made using infrared telescopes, which showed that the water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons. The researchers also found that the concentration of deuterium in the Martian water is much higher than on Earth, indicating that Mars once had a lot more water. The findings suggest that Mars was once much wetter and warmer than it is today, which increases the likelihood of life having existed on the planet.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers found that the Earth and Mars had identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water, but on Mars, the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking into outer space. This has resulted in a higher proportion of deuterium in the water on Mars compared to Earth. The scientists used this information to calculate how much water there used to be on Mars, and they found that it would have been enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of the planet.\n\nLastly, the researchers believe that the ancient Martian sea was a deep and continuous body of water that covered a significant fraction of the planet's surface four billion years ago. The evidence comes from an analysis of the water vapor that lingers today in the Martian atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor.</s>"}

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. \u201cA cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,\u201d says the lead author. \u201cThat suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

This means that some dinosaurs may have cooed or made other low-pitched sounds instead of the iconic roar. Additionally, the study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct non-avian dinosaurs. It is likely that some dinosaurs made closed-mouthed vocalizations, perhaps during mating displays, but there is no direct fossil evidence to support this.\n\nIn another study, researchers found that most dinosaur species have yet to be discovered, and that much remains unknown about dinosaurs. The study also suggested that some dinosaurs may have mumbled or cooed with closed mouths, similar to birds.\n\nThe researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The challenges in finding basic information about which areas have already been searched, subjective judgment, and the possibility that an earlier search covered an area including the wreckage site but missed it. The probability of the plane being found in locations that had already been searched is lowered. The case of Air France Flight 447, where the Bayesian approach helped find the wreckage, is discussed. Keller and her team from Metron Inc in Virginia relied on Bayesian statistics to work out the most likely location of the plane. The team split up the search area into a grid, applied to each cell a figure representing the probability that the plane would be found there. The case of the Air France plane, where the Bayesian approach helped find the wreckage, is discussed. The Metron statisticians adapted their model to the possible scenario of neither the black box nor the voice recorder sending a signal. The team returned to the scene to look and found the plane. The mystery of the crash was solved. The Bayesian approach allows for the consideration of all the data, including uncertainties, and the combination of views that contradict each other.

There have been ongoing clashes between the government and rebels in the area, with reports of heavy gunfire and casualties on both sides. The attack on the army command headquarters has raised concerns about the deep reach of the rebels and their ability to target significant locations in the capital. The conflict in Syria has been ongoing for 18 months and has caused significant destruction and loss of life. The UN Secretary-General has demanded international action to stop the war, but efforts to pass resolutions in the UN Security Council have been blocked by vetoes from Russia and China. The conflict has also had global ramifications and has been a focus of attention at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York this week.\n\nIn addition to the bombings in Damascus, there have been reports of attacks on security sites and symbols of regime power in other areas of the country. The conflict has killed nearly 30,000 people, and there are concerns about the growing threat to international peace and security. The US has pledged support for Syrians trying to oust President Bashar Assad, while other countries have called for international action to stop the war. The situation in Syria remains dire, with ongoing violence and a lack of progress towards a political solution.\n\nFinally, Press TV correspondent Maya Naser was killed while reporting on the twin bombings in Damascus. The attack on the media has raised concerns about the safety of journalists covering the conflict, and Press TV has vowed to pursue the matter of Naser's murder and hold those responsible accountable.</s>"}

The 800-page report lays out the committee's findings on the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead. Here's what you need to know: Benghazi is \"unlikely to be a potent tool for weakening Clinton\" in the general election, as the committee and report have little credibility and aren't seen as serious by many, the Los Angeles Times reports. Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of \u201cculpability or wrongdoing\u201d on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being \u201cone of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times.

The attack, which was detected by a cloud service provider and a security research company, involved a fake login page intended to gather usernames and passwords for a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the DNC's voter database. It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company DigitalOcean. The company's chief security officer says the threat was identified before the attack was launched. \"We see no evidence that any sensitive data was stolen,\" he says. A DNC official tells the Times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the DNC was ultimately traced to Russia. This latest attempt, DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord tells the Times, \"is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks.\" Earlier this week, Microsoft reported that it had uncovered new Russian hacking attempts targeting conservative organizations in the US."], "response": "The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has reported an attempt to hack into its voter database, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigating the incident. The DNC believes the attempt was a sophisticated phishing test, but Microsoft has detected Russian intelligence hackers targeting the Senate and conservative think tanks. Facebook has also identified disinformation efforts targeting people around the world. The incident highlights the ongoing threats to midterm elections, with the cyber age changing elections forever and making systems vulnerable to manipulation. Efforts to breach think tanks and continued influence operations by Russia and others using social media underscore the need for vigilance to prevent future attacks. The DNC and two security companies involved in detecting the operation believe they thwarted a potential attack, but the incident serves as a reminder of the constant threats to election security.</s>"}

Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "response": "According to the two passages, obesity is a growing global problem that affects both developed and developing countries. The most recent research shows that obesity has become a significant public health issue, with nearly 30% of the world's population being overweight or obese. \n\nThe USA leads the world in obesity, but other countries like Tonga, Kuwait, and Kiribati have even higher obesity rates. Obesity co-exists with pockets of hunger in many countries, and the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles are contributing factors.  \n\nObesity is a complex problem with significant health implications, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers. According to the World Health Organization, chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually. \n\nThe most comprehensive assessment to date of one of the pressing public health dilemmas of our time shows that population-wide weight gains and income gains generally go hand in hand around the world. Obesity is now gripping people of all ages, incomes, and regions, with no country succeeding in cutting its obesity rate. \n\nYoung people are also being affected, with obesity rising nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide. The study concludes that obesity is not just a cosmetic issue but a main risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and it is essential to address this issue to improve public health.</s>"}
